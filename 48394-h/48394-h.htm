<p>The number and variety of the insect pests which live on the
plants of New Zealand, whether native or introduced, and the
damage which they frequently do, form the excuse for the
appearance of this work. The descriptions of these insects in
the Transactions of the New Zealand Institute, or in works
published in Europe and America, are not easily accessible to
the general reader, and are also much scattered and fragmentary.
It was thought therefore that the time had arrived when the
information which might be useful to gardeners and tree-growers,
as well as to students, might be summarized and
brought together in a compendious form, and the present volume
is an attempt towards this.</p>

<p>In order to render this work complete a second volume is
necessary, which should include the large number of other
destructive insects preying upon various plants. For example,
the "pine-blight" (<i>Kermaphis</i>), the "American blight"
(<i>Eriosoma</i>), the "black leech" (<i>Tenthredo</i>), the cabbage caterpillar,
the turnip "fly," the various aphides on roses, geraniums,
&amp;c., the grass-grub (<i>Odontria</i>), the codlin-moth, the borers,
weevils, wireworms, and a number of others are in different
places damaging trees and plants, and it would be useful to
collect in one volume information regarding them. The author
has had in contemplation the preparation of such a volume, and
it is hoped that it may be at some future time published.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the present is offered as, at least as far as it
goes, a full description of one of the most general as well as the
most noxious families of plant-parasites. The plates have been
especially prepared with a double object: first, that gardeners
and tree-growers might be able easily to recognize the kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2p" id="Page_2p">« 2 »</a></span>
insect which might happen to be damaging their plants; and,
secondly, that the student who should desire to know more of
this curious family might have enough details indicated to guide
him in his investigation. For the first purpose the figures have
been coloured as near to nature as possible; for the second a
few anatomical details have been introduced. The printing of
these plates has been executed by Mr. Potts, lithographer to
Mr. A. Willis, of Wanganui, and it is hoped that the reader
may be well satisfied with the care and trouble which have been
bestowed upon them.</p>

<p>The author is sensible that this volume may contain
numerous imperfections; but these will not, he trusts, be
attributed to culpable ignorance or carelessness.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Abdomen.</i> The posterior half of the body of male or female, whether joined to
the anterior half or slightly separated, segmented or not.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Abdominal cleft.</i> A narrow slit in the extremity of the abdomen of Lecanidinæ
and the full-grown <i>Hemicoccidinæ</i> only. (<a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>, Fig. 1, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>.) On the
upper side of the body are seen the</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Abdominal lobes</i>, two minute, divergent, triangular or conical, excrescences, one
on each side of the cleft, in <i>Lecanidinæ</i>, usually bearing one or more hairs.
(<a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI.</a>, Fig. 3, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Abdominal spike.</i> A more or less long, tubular or semi-tubular, pointed process
terminating the abdomen of the male in all species, and serving as a sheath
for the penis, which is a long, white, soft tube with recurved hairs. (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate
II.</a>, Fig. 3; <a href="#Plate_XXI">XXI</a>, Fig. 1, <i>k</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Anal ring, anogenital ring.</i> An orifice situated near the abdominal extremity
of the female, either simple or compound, hairless or bearing several hairs.
(<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II.</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Anal tubercles.</i> Exhibited only by the <i>Coccidinæ</i> and by the larvæ of <i>Hemicoccidinæ</i>:
two more or less conspicuous projecting processes at the abdominal
extremity of the female, without any cleft, and in most instances
projecting beyond the edge; usually bearing setæ. (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II.</a>, Fig. 2, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Antennæ.</i> Two jointed organs ("feelers") projecting from the anterior portion
of the body, of variable length. (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Figs. 9, 10, 11, types.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Apodous.</i> Without feet.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Apterous.</i> Without wings.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Bucca</i>, <i>buccal</i>. The mouth; belonging to the mouth.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Carina</i>, <i>carinated</i>. A keel or raised-ridge; keeled.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Cephalic region.</i> That part of the insect, male or female, which bears the eyes,
antennæ, and mouth, but not including the first pair of feet.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Clavate.</i> Club-shaped; somewhat knobbed.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Claw.</i> The hooked terminating joint of the foot. (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Fig. 6, <i>cl.</i>, type.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Coxa.</i> The first joint of the foot, springing directly from the under-side of the
thoracic region. (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Figs. 6 <i>c</i>, 7 <i>c</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Digitules.</i> Appendages observed on the feet, and often useful for distinguishing
species. Usually there are two pairs. The "upper pair" spring from the
upper side of the extremity of the tarsus, and are generally long, fine
hairs, terminating in a knob. The "lower pair" spring from the base of
the claw, and are usually broader and more trumpet-shaped than the upper
ones. (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Fig. 8, type.) Sometimes either pair, or both, may be absent.
In <i>C&oelig;lostoma wairoense</i> there are no "upper" digitules, and 24 "lower"
ones on the foot of the male. (<a href="#Plate_XXI">Plate XXI</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Dimerous.</i>   Two-jointed.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Dorsum.</i>   The upper side of the body when the insect is in its natural position.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Dorsal.</i>   On the upper side or dorsum.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Eyes.</i> Two coloured, granular or simple, round organs on the cephalic region of
the female, near the base of the antennæ (<a href="#Plate_XIV">Plate XIV</a>, Fig. 2, <i>k</i>.; Plate
xx., <i>b</i>); two, or four, coloured, granular, simple or facetted, on the head of
the male (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Figs. 14, 15; <a href="#Plate_XXI">Plate XXI</a>, Fig. 2, <i>b</i>).</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Femur.</i> The second joint of the feet, next the coxa, joined to it by the false
joint "trochanter."   (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Figs. 6 <i>f</i>, 7 <i>f</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Fringe.</i> A portion of the excreted substance, cotton or wax, produced by the
spinnerets on the edge of the body in certain <i>Lecanidinæ</i> and <i>Hemicoccidinæ</i>.
It may be in the form of long glassy threads (<i>Planchonia</i>) or of
more or less broad flat plates (<i>Ctenochiton</i>). (<a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a>, Figs. 2 <i>d</i>, 3 <i>a</i>;
<a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII</a>, Fig. 2, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Haltere.</i> A minute organ, situated just behind the wings of the males, and of
which the use, either in this family or in the Diptera, has not been satisfactorily
ascertained. It is often termed the "balancer." In the house-fly
it has been thought to represent an organ of hearing. In Coccids it is
furnished with one or more hooked bristles, and Mr. Comstock affirms that
these are, probably for some purposes of flight, hooked into the posterior
edges of the wings.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>   (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 17; <a href="#Plate_XXI">Plate XXI</a>, Fig. 1, <i>m</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Honeydew.</i> A substance of a glutinous character produced by many species, and
falling in spray from them on the leaves.   (See Chap. III.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Larva.</i> The first stage in the insect's life after emerging from the egg.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Lobes</i>, in the <i>Diaspidinæ</i>, are minute, flat, more or less rounded projections, two
or more, seen on the edge of the abdominal extremity, usually interspersed
with spines and hairs (<a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a>, Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5, <i>l</i>); in the <i>Lecanidinæ</i>, are
two triangular or conical projections, usually bearing hairs, on the dorsal
side of the body, one on each side of the abdominal cleft (<a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI</a>, Fig. 3,
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>).</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Mentum.</i> A kind of secondary rostrum, or "under-lip," not altogether tubular,
but rather a deepish trough, through which the rostral setæ pass after leaving
the rostrum. It may have one, two, or three joints. It is not noticeable
in the Diaspidinæ.   (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 5, <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Metamorphosis.</i> A change of form. For the number and characters of these see
Chap. II.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Moniliform.</i>   Like a string of beads.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Monomerous.</i>   With a single joint.</p>

<p><i>Multilocular.</i> With several divisions: a term applied to the spinneret orifices
of some insects, distinguishing them from "simple" orifices, which show
only a single tube. Multilocular orifices exhibit a bundle of tubes enclosed
together.   (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 4, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>p</i>; <a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII</a>, Fig. 2, <i>e</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Nervure.</i> A strong vein which, starting from the attachment of the wing of
the male, runs along the anterior edge of the wing, a little within it: at
about half its length a branch runs obliquely towards the posterior edge.
(<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, 16; <a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>, <i>f</i>; <a href="#Plate_XXI">Plate XXI</a>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Normal.</i>   According to rule&mdash;not exceptional.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Ocelli.</i> Two, four, or six minute circular simple organs, on the head of the
male: probably organs of vision. In the <i>Monophlebidæ</i> they would seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
to be replaced by a smooth rounded protuberance behind the eye.   (Plate
i., Fig. 14, <i>oc.</i>; <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII</a>, Fig. 2, <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>; <a href="#Plate_XXI">Plate XXI</a>, Fig. 2, <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Ovisac.</i>   The cottony bag or nest formed by certain species of <i>Lecanidinæ</i> and
<i>Coccidinæ</i> for the reception of their eggs.   (<a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII</a>, Fig. 1, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>;
<a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Peduncle</i>, <i>pedunculated</i>.   A stalk; stalked.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Pellicle.</i> The skin of an earlier stage, cast off at each metamorphosis; used by
the <i>Diaspidinæ</i> and by one genus of <i>Lecanidinæ</i> in the formation of the
puparium or test.   (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 3, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>; <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a>, Fig. 2, <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Polymerous.</i>   Many-jointed.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Pupa.</i>   The last stage of the male insect before emerging winged.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Puparium.</i> The shield, covering, or "scale" of the <i>Diaspidinæ</i>. (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig.
3, e; Plates iv., v., vi.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Rostral setæ.</i> Three or, in a few cases, four long, fine, curling, tubular bristles
springing from the rostrum, and often passing through a mentum; used for
insertion into the tissues of a plant and sucking their contents. (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>,
Fig. 5; <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI</a>, only one being here shown, from the smallness of the
drawings.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Rostrum.</i> A more or less conical, tubular, projecting organ, or beak, protruding
from the under-side of the cephalic region, or between the first pair of feet.
It is absent in the adult female <i>C&oelig;lostoma</i>. It is the "mouth" of the insect.
(<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 5; <a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV</a>, Fig. 5.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Sac.</i> The cottony, bag-like covering or nest produced by the spinnerets and
concealing the insect in many of the <i>Coccidinæ</i> and some <i>Lecanidinæ</i>.
(<a href="#Plate_XV">Plate XV</a>, Fig. 1, <i>c</i>; Fig. 2, <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Scale.</i> The shield or puparium of the <i>Diaspidinæ</i>. The word is commonly
used to designate the outward appearance of insects of the whole family,
which are indiscriminately called "scale-insects," although many of them
form no shield whatever.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Secretion</i> may be of various kinds. It is matter produced by internal organs, and
expelled through the "spinnerets." In the <i>Diaspidinæ</i> the secreted portion
of the puparium (that is, all except the pellicles) is made up of fine, closely-woven
fibres, forming the "scale." In the <i>Lecanidinæ</i> it probably exudes
originally as fine fibres, but these become agglomerated in some cases in a
waxy or horny mass, or in others are loosely collected as cotton. In the
<i>Coccidinæ</i> the secretion is usually cottony, or powdery like meal.
<i>C&oelig;lostoma</i> secretes all three&mdash;wax, cotton, and meal. In some instances,
as in <i>Carteria lacca</i>, of Africa, the wax, called "shellac," is abundant
enough to be commercially valuable; or, as in the Chinese <i>Ericerus Pe-la</i>
it can be used for making candles.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Seta.</i>   A bristle&mdash;a long stiff hair.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Setose.</i>   Bearing a few bristles.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Spinnerets.</i> Organs observed in various parts of the body, producing the waxy,
cottony, or mealy matter. They consist of cylindrical internal tubes, sometimes
ending on the skin, sometimes protruding outside it in the form of
tubes, spines, or conical hairs. In the former case the orifices show them to be
in some instances simple, and in others compound tubes.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> In the <i>Diaspidinæ</i>,
besides being scattered over the body, the spinnerets are arranged in groups
on the last abdominal segment, and these groups afford excellent characters
for specific distinctions. (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 4, for types of various spinnerets;
<a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a>, groups of spinnerets of <i>Diaspidinæ</i>.)</p>

<p class="caption2">INTRODUCTORY.</p>


<p>Insects are divided by naturalists into several principal orders,
the distinguishing marks of which are generally very well defined&mdash;for
example, the butterflies and moths belong to the
order <i>Lepidoptera</i>, the dragon-flies to the <i>Neuroptera</i>, the common
house-flies to the <i>Diptera</i>, and so on. These orders are
founded upon the characters and arrangement of the wings.
They are subdivided into families, and these again into genera
and species. One of the orders is that of the <span class="smcap">Hemiptera</span>,
which is composed of the two following sections:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Hemiptera-Heteroptera</span>, including the bugs, water-beetles,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hemiptera-Homoptera</span>, including the crickets, cuckoo-spits,
plant-lice (Aphides), leaf-hoppers (Psyllids), scale-insects
(Coccids), &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The insects treated of in this volume are therefore placed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p0" style="margin-left:30%">
Class&mdash;<span class="smcap">Insecta</span>.<br />
Order&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hemiptera</span>.<br />
Section&mdash;<span class="smcap">Homoptera</span>.<br />
Family&mdash;<span class="smcap">Coccididæ</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>The genera and species will be found in their places.</p>

<p>The common English name for this family&mdash;"scale-insects"&mdash;is
not very appropriate. Some few of them have the appearance
of small thin scales on leaves or twigs, but many have not. Nor
are the German appellations&mdash;"gall-insekten" or "schild-lause"&mdash;more
appropriate. Gardeners have given to some of them the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
name of "mealy-bug," which, although decidedly neither elegant
nor euphonious, very fairly represents the character of that particular
portion of the family.</p>

<p>The origin of the name "Coccididæ," or, as abbreviated
often in this volume, "Coccids," is found in the old Greek word
"[Greek: kokkos]," denoting a rich red dye, which was much admired by
the Greeks and Romans, and which was procured from the insect
now known as <i>Kermes vermilio</i> (the <i>Coccus ilicis</i> of Linnæus).
When the cochineal insect was discovered in Mexico it soon
overpowered all the others, producing commercial dyes, and from
it has come the title "Coccid," now applied to the whole family.
Cochineal itself has of late years been pushed aside to a great
extent by the aniline (coal-tar) dyes; yet it is still used for
many purposes. This insect lives on the leaves of cactus.
Amongst the New Zealand species described in this work will be
found one, <i>Dactylopius alpinus</i>, which produces a red dye similar
to, though probably not equal to, cochineal. Before the discovery
of aniline dyes it might possibly have been worth while
to cultivate this insect for its dye; but this would scarcely
answer now.</p>

<p>The Coccididæ are, in some parts of the world, very injurious
to vegetation. They seem to affect principally the warmer
temperate regions. California, Florida, the Cape of Good Hope,
the southern parts of Australia, Southern France and Northern
Italy, and New Zealand are countries in which they are found
out-of-doors in the greatest numbers. In England they are less
troublesome in the open air, though in greenhouses and hothouses
they abound; but, in places under glass, every gardener
ought to be able to get rid of them without difficulty. For its
extent New Zealand seems to furnish a larger number than any
other country. The humidity of its climate and the absence of
anything like severe winters in most parts of it are quite congenial
to Coccids; and there is scarcely a tree in its forests or
in its gardens, whether native or introduced, which is not subject
to their attacks.</p>

<p>It has not been thought necessary to include in this work a
list of the books and essays written on this family of insects.
The list would be a very long one; but, besides that many of
the books would not be obtainable here, it would be found
that very many authors have done nothing more than copy&mdash;often
quite blindly and unintelligently&mdash;what others had said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
before them; moreover, most of them are out of date. The
student or the horticulturist desiring to know more about Coccids
not found in New Zealand may find full details in the reports
of the Agricultural Department of the United States Government,
in Dr. V. Signoret's "Essai sur les Cochenilles" (Paris), in
papers by Miss Emily Smith (American naturalist, 1878-80),
&amp;c. The American Departmental Reports of Professors Riley
and Comstock, Mr. Hubbard, and Mr. L. Howard contain most
valuable information. English works on the subject are mostly
fragmentary or inaccurate; but Mr. Douglas, of Lewisham, has
lately begun to discuss the Coccids in England in a systematic
manner, and probably before long others will follow suit. In
India, Mr. T. W. Atkinson, of Calcutta, is studying the family.</p>

<p>Natural science in these days tends ever more and more
towards specialization, and the boundaries of scientific classes,
orders, families, &amp;c., are becoming always more and more
narrowed. The student can find his time quite sufficiently occupied
nowadays in the thorough investigation of so (comparatively)
small a portion of the animal kingdom as is presented
by the Coccids of even only one country; and the present work
may not be without value to future workers in this direction.
To the farmer, the gardener, the fruit-grower, and the owner
of pleasure-grounds it is believed that the following chapters
will also supply information at the same time correct, intelligible,
and useful.</p>

<p class="caption2">CHARACTERS, LIFE-HISTORY, AND METAMORPHOSES
OF THE COCCIDIDÆ.</p>


<p>The first principal character separating the Coccididæ from the
rest of the Homoptera, and distinguishable without microscopic
examination, is the absence of wings in the females at all stages
of their existence.</p>

<p>The second principal character is the absence of any
apparatus for feeding and digesting in the males.</p>

<p>From these two characters it follows that the females can
only extend their operations by, at the best, crawling from
plant to plant, or by being carried about by birds or other
agency; also that the males cannot enjoy more than a very short
existence, their work being entirely confined to impregnating
the females. Hence, in any endeavours to destroy these insects,
the males may be disregarded, and the females only attended to.</p>

<p>Other distinguishing characters, chiefly microscopic, are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The presence of only one joint in the tarsus or fourth
joint of the leg, in both males and females (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Figs. 6
and 7, <i>ta</i>);</p>

<p>2. The presence of only a single claw terminating the leg in
both males and females (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Figs. 6 and 7);</p>

<p>3. The presence of only two wings, with two halteres, in
the full-grown males (<a href="#Plate_XXI">Plate XXI.</a>);</p>

<p>4. The presence of two or more eyes or ocular tubercles, in
addition to the ordinary pair of eyes, in the full-grown males
(<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Fig. 14; <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a>, Fig. 1, <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>).</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">I. The Female Insect.</span></p>

<p>In general outward appearance the female insects present
very variable forms. They may be either naked, or covered
over with some kind of a shield, which may be fibrous, or waxy,
or cottony, or they may have simply a thin powdery meal
scattered over them. The covered insects are, of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
stationary, although in some cases, before reaching their full
development, they move about, carrying their houses with them.
The naked insects may be either stationary or active.</p>

<p>They attach themselves either to the bark or stem of a plant
or to the leaves. In the latter case it is rare to find them on
the upper side; but, on turning over a leaf, the under-surface
is frequently found covered thickly with them.</p>

<p>In many cases they exude, in the form of minute
globules, a whitish, thick, gummy secretion, answering probably
to the "honeydew" of the Aphididæ. This secretion drops
from them on to the plant, and from it grows a black fungus,
which soon gives an unsightly appearance to the plant. This
fungus or "smut" is an almost invariable indication that a
plant is attacked by insects,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and may, indeed, give a useful
warning to tree-growers. It is not, however, produced in
appreciable quantities by all species.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> Not necessarily a Coccid insect: the fungus may also grow on the honeydew
of Aphis; but it is easy to recognize the difference between these insects.
In every case there is some insect at work where the fungus is.</p></div>

<p>The manner of feeding upon the plant is the same as in all
the families of Homoptera&mdash;namely, by means of a protruding
rostrum, beak, or trunk, situated on the under-side of the
insect. As there is not, in the female Coccididæ, any well-defined
division between the head and the rest of the body, this
rostrum is seen, on turning over the insect, in the form, usually,
of a minute conical projection between, or nearly between, the
first pair of legs, if the legs are present, or a little within the
circumference, if the legs are absent (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Fig. 5). An
ordinary lens will generally show, springing from the point of
the conical rostrum, three or four longish, very fine, curling
bristles. These bristles are, in fact, hollow tubes, and the insect,
inserting them into the leaf or bark of the plant, sucks through
them its food. It is thus plain that, with often great numbers
of scale-insects sucking at it&mdash;pumping, as it were, its life-blood
through their rostra&mdash;a plant must of necessity suffer greatly.</p>

<p>Birds do not, as a rule, seem to care much about eating
the Coccididæ, whose work is thus little interfered with by
them. The "white-eye" (Zosterops) or "blight-bird" has
been seen feeding on scale-insects; but its visits are few and far
between, and its assistance to the gardener in this respect not
great. The Coccididæ are, however, much subject to attacks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
from Hymenopterous parasites, of which some account will be
found in a subsequent chapter (<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chap. IV.</a>).</p>

<p>The effects of the Coccididæ are not confined altogether to
damage to plants: there are some species producing materials
useful to man. For example, <i>Coccus cacti</i> produces cochineal;
<i>Carteria lacca</i> produces shellac; <i>Ericerus pé-la</i> is used by the
Chinese for candles: and others might be mentioned. But, so
far, no New Zealand species appears to be of any commercial
use. <i>Dactylopius alpinus</i> makes a rather rich red dye in alcohol;
<i>Cælostoma zealandicum</i> constructs thick, waxy coverings, which
might possibly be turned to some account; but even these are
probably not worth much.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Groups.</i></p>

<p>The groups into which the Coccididæ are, in this work,
divided are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockq1a">1. Female insects constructing for themselves shields
composed partly of secretion, partly of the pellicles
discarded from earlier stages; abdomen not cleft; legs
lost at full growth.</p>

<p class="blockq1a">4. Female insects naked, or covered with secretion either

<p class="blockq2"><span class="smcap"><a href="#COCCIDINAE">Coccidinæ.</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><i>Life-history.</i></p>

<p>The life-history of the insects in the above groups is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>All of them pass through four stages of existence: 1, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
egg; 2, the young larva; 3, the second stage of life, or
"pupa;" 4, the adult, or full-grown insect.</p>

<p>1. <i>The egg.</i> This is, in all cases, of regularly-oval form,
the colour varying from white to yellow or red (see <a href="#Plate_I">Plate i</a>,
Fig. 1). It may be produced in great numbers, and in some
cases several times in a year. As a general rule, the female ejects
the eggs from her body; but there are some species, notably
in the group <i>Lecanidinæ</i>, where the eggs are hatched within the
body, the insect being thus, in a manner, viviparous.</p>

<p>2. <i>The young larva</i> (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Fig. 2). This is of precisely
the same form both for the male and the female&mdash;or, rather,
perhaps it should be said that no definite character has yet been
discovered to show which are male and which are female larvæ.
Neglecting slight variations of form, the larva is very minute&mdash;seldom
more than about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>30</sub> in. long, often as small as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> in.&mdash;oval,
flattish, possessing a rostrum and accompanying bristles
(setæ), six legs, and two antennæ: and in all species it is fairly
active, travelling as soon as hatched over the plant in search of
food.</p>

<p>3. <i>The second stage.</i> Here the first distinction is noticeable
between the male and the female in most cases; but this distinction
usually depends not so much upon the form of the
insect as upon the character of the covering it makes for itself.
Confining ourselves at present to the female, there are differences
now noticeable between the groups. In the <i>Diaspidinæ</i> the
insect begins by slipping out of the skin of the larva; but it
does not cast it aside altogether: it makes use of the old skin
as part of its covering. Adding to it a small portion of fibrous
secretion&mdash;produced by organs called "spinnerets," which will
be noticed presently&mdash;it attaches itself to the plant by its rostrum
and setæ, and lies, inert and stationary, under a little shield
composed half of its old skin and half of secretion. As it also,
in entering this stage, loses its legs altogether, it must remain
in the position it has chosen for the rest of its life. In the
<i>Lecanidinæ</i> and in the <i>Coccidinæ</i> the skin of the larva is thrown
away altogether, and the female in her second stage takes up a
new position, in which she may be either naked or covered with
a thin coat of secretion, active or stationary, retaining her legs
in most cases, or losing them in some instances. In all the
groups there is almost always some approach to the form of the
full-grown insect noticeable in this second stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>The full-grown insect.</i> Here there is almost unlimited
variety of form, colour, and habits. The insects may be naked
or covered, active or stationary. In the <i>Diaspidinæ</i> the process
just described is repeated: the female slips out of her second
skin, but still keeps both it and the first over her, adding more
fibrous secretion from the spinnerets; so that, in fact, she lies an
inert, legless, slug-like object, under a covering composed partly
of the two skins, partly of secretion. (See <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Fig. 3: <i>a</i> is
the discarded larval skin, <i>b</i> the discarded skin of the second
stage, both being used as part of the shield. In the genus
<i>Aspidiotus</i> these skins would be in the centre instead of at one
end.) In the <i>Lecanidinæ</i> (except in one single genus) and the
<i>Coccidinæ</i> the second skin is discarded altogether; but the insect
may either construct a new shield or remain naked, may be
either with or without legs, either active or stationary. Once
this last stage of her existence entered upon, the female prepares
for laying her eggs. In most species the services of a male are
needed; in some, as far as can be made out after investigation
of many years, no males are found. The female, if naked,
either hatches her eggs in her own body or lays them on the
plant; if covered, she fills her shield with the eggs. The naked
insects often cover the eggs themselves&mdash;e.g., <i>Lecanium hemisphæricum</i>;
or, again, deposit them in an ovisac, a mass of
cottony secretion&mdash;e.g., <i>Pulvinaria camellicola</i> or <i>Icerya purchasi</i>.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">II. The Male Insect.</span></p>

<p>It has been remarked above that, as the full-grown males of
the <i>Coccididæ</i> are destitute of any organs for feeding whatsoever,
there is no reason for making systematic attacks on them
for economical purposes. Their function is simply to impregnate
the females, and their life at this stage must necessarily be very
brief. It will suffice in this place to observe that in all cases
these males are small, two-winged flies, their size varying from
about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>40</sub> in. to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> in. in length; colour usually yellow or red;
wings longer than the body, hyaline (glassy) and often
iridescent, and, in repose, lying flat, partly crossing each other.
The antennæ are long, slender, and hairy, consisting of nine or
ten joints. The legs are also slender and hairy, the tarsus
having only one joint, and terminating in a single claw. The
insects are generally very active. Types of antenna, foot, wing
and haltere, and a diagram of the arrangement of the eyes and
ocelli, are given in <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Figs. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span></p>

<p>The males are thus so small and rapid in their movements
that it is difficult in most cases to find them in a free state.
The usual way to procure them is by hatching them from the
pupæ. In their course of life they pass through four stages, as
do the females&mdash;viz.: 1, the egg; 2, the larva; 3, the pupa;
4, the full-grown insect.</p>

<p>1. <i>The egg</i> is, as far as can be made out, precisely the same
as that of the female, though Dr. Signoret believes that in one
or two species there may perhaps be minute differences.</p>

<p>2. <i>The larva</i> is, as stated above, similar to that of the
female.</p>

<p>3. <i>The pupa.</i> Here the first distinctions between the sexes
may be noted, and these are principally observable in the
cocoons or puparia, rather than in the insect itself&mdash;at least to
outward appearance. The male pupa is, in all cases&mdash;even in
those where the female pupa is naked&mdash;enclosed in some kind
of covering. In the <i>Diaspidinæ</i> the puparium is formed partly
of fibrous secretion and partly of discarded skin; only, as the
full-grown male emerges from it as a fly, and does not remain
on the plant, there can be only one such skin&mdash;that of the
larva; consequently it is easy to distinguish the male puparia
from the shields of the adult females by the presence of only
one discarded pellicle instead of two. In the <i>Lecanidinæ</i> and
the <i>Coccidinæ</i> the male puparia are distinguishable usually by a
narrower and more cylindrical form than those of the females,
where these latter are covered; in the naked species the males
are generally in white waxy or cottony cocoons.</p>

<p>Examination of the pupæ in these coverings will generally
show more or less developed processes on the back and sides,
which are so evidently the rudiments of the future wings that
the presence of a male is not doubtful. In other respects the
male pupæ are not always to be distinguished from the females.</p>

<p>3. <i>The full-grown male</i> has been described above. It is
usually easy to procure specimens, provided the pupæ are obtained.
If any of these, in their coverings, are put into pillboxes
with glass tops, or any place where light reaches them,
they will generally produce the full-grown insect sometimes in
a few days, sometimes after several weeks. The time of year
for this seems very variable. Males emerge from the puparia
apparently indifferently (in New Zealand) in summer or winter.</p>

<p class="caption2">PRODUCTS OF THE COCCIDIDÆ.</p>

<p>[Waxy or cottony matter: the "honeydew" and the black fungus&mdash;"smut" or
"black blight"&mdash;growing upon it.]</p>


<p>The Coccididæ, in some parts of the world, excrete various
substances which are of commercial value, as, for example,
shellac, "manna," candle-wax, &amp;c. Cochineal is not in the
same category, as it appears to be a colouring-matter pervading
every cell of the tissues of the insect from which it is extracted&mdash;<i>Coccus
cacti</i>. But there is no need to dwell here upon the
ordinary excretions of the New Zealand insects, as they appear to
be not sufficient either in quantity or quality for any practical
service. The fibrous puparia of the <i>Diaspidinæ</i> appear to
be quite useless. The tests of the <i>Lecanodiaspidæ</i>, such as
<i>Ctenochiton perforatus</i>, <i>Inglisia ornata</i>, &amp;c., although more or less
waxy (but of very brittle material, often more like glass) are
much too insignificant to repay any trouble taken to collect
them. Of all the family, <i>Cælostoma zælandicum</i>, in its second
stage, seems to produce the greatest amount of material, its
large, hard, waxy tests being very thick and solid, and often
clustered in hundreds on a root or a twig of Muhlenbeckia; but,
supposing this substance (of which the true chemical nature<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> is
not yet known) to be fit for some purpose, there does not seem
to be any means of cultivating the insect to profit. <i>Dactylopius
alpinus</i> produces in alcohol a rich red tint, and this not by
way of excretion, but from the colouring matters of its tissues,
as in the case of <i>Coccus cacti</i>; but here, again, the rarity of the
insect and its out-of-the-way habitat would be a bar, even if
nowadays it were worth while to cultivate a New Zealand
cochineal. At present, therefore, there seems no reason to
believe that the Coccididæ of this country are likely to furnish
any products of a useful or commercial character.</p>

<div class="footnote">

for analysis, no more being available at the time. Mr. Skey considered it as a
new substance, probably of the nature of a gum, not resinous; but further
examination of larger quantities is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>There is, however, one substance produced by these insects
which has an injurious effect upon the plants they grow on.
This is a transparent glutinous fluid, apparently analogous to
that exuding from Aphides, and which may receive the name of
"honeydew," as in that family. In fact, this fluid would seem
to be produced by most of the Rhynchota, for the Psyllidæ and
Aleurodidæ also excrete it. The quantity issuing from Coccids
seems to vary greatly. In some cases&mdash;e.g., <i>Lecanium hesperidum</i>,
<i>Ctenochiton viridis</i> or <i>perforatus</i>, <i>Fiorinia asteliæ</i>&mdash;the insects
appear to discharge "honeydew" freely; in others&mdash;e.g., <i>Mytilaspis
pomorum</i>, <i>Rhizococcus fossor</i>&mdash;none, or scarcely any fluid,
is excreted. But in no case does it appear that our Coccids<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
form honeydew to the same extent as the Aphides, which are
stated to produce sometimes quantities that may be gathered
from the leaves or the soil by the pound weight. It is not
so much the amount exuding from each insect as the great
number of insects on a plant which renders the Coccid honeydew
obnoxious: each individual may excrete only a little, but when,
as usually happens, there are many hundreds of individuals
together, the result, for the reasons given below, becomes
important to the tree.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> <i>Gossyparia mannipara</i>, an Arabian Coccid, is said to excrete so much that
the Arabs "eat it with their bread like honey." Buckton, "Brit. Aphides,"
Vol. I., p. 42.</p></div>

<p>There is every reason to believe that the honeydew of Coccididæ
is of similar character to that of the Aphididæ, and,
according to analyses by Boussingault, of Paris, and Gunning, of
Amsterdam (Buckton, "Brit. Aphides," Vol. I., pp. 42, 43), the
Aphidian honeydew contains a very large quantity of sugar, and,
curiously enough, cane-sugar. Some observers, noticing in its
composition also glucose and dextrine, have considered it as
of vegetable rather than animal origin; but the weight of
evidence appears to make it certainly the product of the Aphides.
As the present work is intended rather as a manual for gardeners
and tree-growers than as a purely scientific publication, there is
no need to enter more fully into the subject here: it may therefore
be simply stated that the honeydew of Coccididæ probably
contains a large proportion of sugar in various forms.</p>

<p>The mode in which this substance is excreted by the insects
differs somewhat from that of the Aphididæ. On the abdomen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
of Aphis are seen two erect more or less prominent tubes, called
"cornicles" or "nectaries," and it is the function of these to
excrete the honeydew.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> No European entomologist has, it is
believed, seen or described the organ of honeydew-excretion in
the Coccididæ. Some observations by the author of this work
in 1886 demonstrate its existence as a cylindrical tube exserted
from the anogenital orifice after the manner of a telescope, the
furthest-extended tube being the most slender. This organ,
extremely difficult of detection when not in use&mdash;except in the
single genus <i>C&oelig;lostoma</i>&mdash;is at intervals pushed out to its full
extent, and at its further extremity there appears a minute
globule of yellowish, nearly transparent, glutinous fluid, which
rapidly expands like a soap-bubble, and then, suddenly breaking,
falls in spray on the leaf beneath. In the second stage of the
female of <i>C&oelig;lostoma zælandicum</i> this organ may be detected
more easily than in any other Coccid; but the act of protrusion
of the organ and the formation of the drop of honeydew are
apparently by no means frequent, and many long observations
may be made without witnessing either.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> (The organ and the
honeydew-drop are shown in <a href="#Plate_XXII">Plate xxii</a>)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> The fluid also emerges from the anal orifice; but, seemingly, no mention
is made by any observer of any special honeydew-organ protruding from the anus
of Aphis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> Mr. Comstock ("Report on Insects," U.S. Dept. of Agric., 1881, p. 22) states
that on gently rubbing a <i>Dactylopius</i> two small drops of fluid, which he considers
to be honeydew, can be seen to emerge from orifices on the dorsal side of
the sixth abdominal segment; but he mentions no special organ in the body.
The experiment has been tried on <i>Dactylopius</i> in this country without success.</p></div>

<p>For the purposes of this work further details as to the
production of honeydew are not necessary. But as to its effect
on plants it is requisite to be more particular, and the attention
of tree-growers and gardeners is specially directed to the following
points. It has been said above that when the bubble of
honeydew has been expanded to its full size it breaks into spray.
Now, as a general rule, Coccids are found almost exclusively on
the <i>under</i> sides of leaves (when not on the bark). Some, as
<i>Lecanium hesperidum</i> and a few others, may be seen on the
upper side; but the general rule is as here stated. It follows
that the spray of honeydew from the burst bubble falls, not on
the leaf where the insect is, but on the <i>upper</i> sides of the leaves
below it. These upper surfaces, being more exposed to light
and air than the lower ones, are usually deserted not only by
the Coccids but by other insects also, and so there is not much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
chance that the honeydew spray so falling will be disturbed. It
consequently rapidly accumulates and forms a coating on the
leaf where it rests. From this result two things, or, rather, the
same injurious effect on the plant is produced in two ways. First,
the honeydew itself, being, as stated, of a glutinous nature, tends
to stop up and choke the stomata (or, in plain English, the
breathing-orifices of the leaves) and so retard the growth of the
tree. Secondly, the honeydew, being of a saccharine nature, is
especially attractive to fungoid growths, and these fungi, rapidly
increasing, tend still more to choke the leaves and hamper the
proper functions of the tree.</p>

<p>The second of these is the most important, for, apparently,
the honeydew is scarcely deposited before it becomes the receptacle
for fungus-spores, and these grow with great rapidity. As
a general rule, in New Zealand, these fungi appear to be mostly
of the same family&mdash;the Physomycetes, and they are of a black
or very dark brown colour. From the fact above stated, that
the honeydew falls from the insects upon leaves beneath them,
the lower leaves of a plant are more covered with it than the
upper ones: these black fungi consequently discolour chiefly the
lower leaves and branches; often the uppermost branches are
nearly free from them. But the effect produced on the tree is
not only unsightly, from the sooty blackness, but also injurious,
from the choking-up of the stomata both by the honeydew and
the fungus. As for ornamental plants, whether under glass or
in the open air, the black coating is quite sufficient to spoil
them.</p>

<p>These fungi are of various species, and specimens are given
here in <a href="#Plate_XXII">Plate xxii</a>: on the leaves they form usually a hard, thin,
black coat; while on the twigs and stem they are of a looser
texture, forming masses of minute erect threads. They are not
confined to New Zealand, and most writers on Coccididæ in
Europe and elsewhere mention them, though only casually.
They are, in fact, apparently, only the usual growths appearing
on any decomposing substance, such as the honeydew is.</p>

<p>Gardeners and tree-growers ought to clearly understand that
the appearance on their plants of this black sooty covering is
almost always an indication of the presence of some Homopterous
insects. In New Zealand, on account of the greater
prevalence of Coccididæ, the insects will most probably be
Coccids; but by no means necessarily so, for many Aphididæ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
Psyllidæ, and Aleurodidæ produce the same effects. This is by
no means as well understood as it should be, either by gardeners
themselves or by those who write on trees and planting. The
fungus growth is usually imagined to be in itself a disease of
the plant, and efforts are made for its treatment without regard
to its real origin, the insects on the leaves or bark. Under the
names of "smut," "black blight," &amp;c., it is often referred to as
a destructive pest; and remedies are suggested which can, of
course, have no permanent effect unless they are equally efficacious
against the insect producing the honeydew. It is probably
from this cause that sulphur, which is an excellent
remedy against fungus, has been so great a favourite with those
who pretend to have discovered what are called "scaly-blight
destroyers;" and gardeners, seeing, perhaps, these nostrums
clean some of the fungus from their trees, are under the false
impression that the "scale" is also cleared away. The truth is,
that the real remedy against "black blight" is to kill the
insects on whose excreta it flourishes, if that can be done. As
to the modes of doing this see Chapter V.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, pretended here that fungi of different
kinds, and even those specially referred to, will not grow
independently of insects and honeydew; and trees are, undoubtedly,
subject to fungoid diseases which are not to be traced
to any animal action. Still, the rule holds good; and the first
effort of a gardener on the appearance of black blight on his
plants should be to discover the insects on its leaves or bark,
and deal directly with them. Once they are destroyed the
fungus growth will in a short time disappear.</p>

<p class="caption2">CHECKS TO INCREASE OF COCCIDIDÆ, PARASITES, ETC.</p>


<p>The Coccididæ, like all Homoptera, produce great numbers of
young; but their increase does not appear to be as rapid as that
of some other families. The numbers of some Aphididæ or
Aleurodidæ produced from a single female in the course of a
single year have been calculated at hundreds of thousands, if not
millions; and as many as eleven generations have been produced
in little over half a year. Coccids, however, as a rule, do not
propagate at this alarming rate. Many, if not the great
majority of them, produce in this country but one generation in
the year, e.g., <i>Mytilaspis pomorum</i>, <i>C&oelig;lostoma zælandicum</i>, &amp;c.
Others, such as <i>Icerya purchasi</i>, breed more often; and probably
climate has a good deal to do with the frequency, for Mr.
Comstock says that in the United States <i>Mytilaspis pomorum</i>
breeds once a year in the North and twice in the South. In
point of fact, it does not seem possible to lay down any rule on
the subject. Unfortunately, <i>Icerya</i> is not only a frequent
breeder, but also the most destructive insect of the family in
New Zealand.</p>

<p>The number of young produced by each female seems also to
vary. The author has counted from 30 to 80 eggs in the
puparium of <i>Mytilaspis pomorum</i>; as many as 350 in the ovisac
of <i>Icerya purchasi</i>, and about the same number of <i>C&oelig;lostoma
zælandicum</i>: and a female of <i>Lecanium hesperidum</i> examined in
spring contained 93 embryos. These figures do not denote any
remarkable fertility; but, as in the majority of cases males are
but seldom met with, sometimes even entirely unknown (e.g.,
<i>Lecanium hesperidum</i>), it follows that nearly every insect is capable
of propagation, and the increase in numbers is therefore more
rapid than might be anticipated otherwise. How the females
in the species apparently destitute of males are enabled to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>produce
young is perhaps one of the most mysterious things in
Nature. The male of <i>Mytilaspis pomorum</i> has never been found
in New Zealand or Europe, and doubtfully in America.
<i>Lecanium hesperidum</i> has been known and studied for nearly two
hundred years without any male, pupa or adult, being discovered.
Yet both of these species go on increasing regularly and in great
numbers, and show no signs of extinction.</p>

<p>In spite of this absence of males in some cases, and of the
comparatively small numbers of eggs, Coccids would naturally increase
at an exceedingly rapid rate if left undisturbed, on account
of the great proportion of females. They are, moreover, protected,
to a great extent&mdash;First, by the fact that birds do not, as
a rule, care to eat them. The "blight-bird" or "white-eye,"
<i>Zosterops lateralis</i>, has been noticed in this country pecking about
in holly-hedges infested by <i>Lecanium hesperidum</i>; but it is not
absolutely certain whether it was eating the Coccids or the other
more easily picked-off insects on the plant, such as <i>Psocus</i>, which
is very commonly observed among Coccids. And other birds
seem not to devour them at all. Secondly, the usual position of
these insects, on the under side of the leaves, or in the crevices
of bark, is a great shelter and protection for them against birds
or ordinary accidents. Again, they are in many cases effectually
covered by the waxy or fibrous shields, or by the masses of
cotton with which they surround themselves. In countries like
the South of France, California, or the greater part of New Zealand,
the winters do not appear to be sufficiently severe to injure
Coccids, and many of them breed as much in winter as they do
in summer. It would therefore seem that everything combines
to assist these insects in their career, and in their propagation.
Nature, however, has provided a check which is to some extent
effective, at least against several species, although, unhappily,
against some of the most noxious&mdash;such as <i>Mytilaspis pomorum</i>,
the Dactylopii (mealy bugs), <i>Icerya purchasi</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;it is not
energetic in this country; and this remedy is the attacks of other
minute animals, whether by direct devouring of the Coccids or
by parasitism.</p>

<p>Direct attacks from animal enemies are not frequent.
Whether from some inherent distastefulness, or from the difficulty
of getting at them, Coccids are scarcely subject to being
directly devoured. There are a few exceptions. Under the
puparia of <i>Mytilaspis pomorum</i> a minute white Acarus (mite)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
may often be found, and it is noticeable that where it abounds the
eggs of the Coccid are often shrivelled or empty. It is not improbable
that this Acarus may feed on the eggs. It appears to
belong to the genus <i>Tyroglyphus</i>, a mite which is not usually
carnivorous; but Mr. A. Michael, an authority on mites, seems
to be uncertain whether <i>Tyroglyphus</i> may not make a meal of
the Coccid.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> No others amongst the Diaspidinæ appear to be
directly attacked, nor any of the Lecanidinæ; but amongst a
number of <i>Dactylopius glaucus</i> on a leaf there may often be seen
a minute caterpillar, apparently covered with many tufts of hair.
This is the larva of the common ladybird (<i>Coccinella</i>), a beetle
which, in both the larval and perfect states, feeds on Aphides,
Coccids, and other insects. The larva may sometimes be seen
holding a <i>Dactylopius</i> in its powerful jaws and devouring it.
Another larva, smooth and without hairs, performs the same
functions&mdash;it is the young of a small dipterous fly, apparently
one of the <i>Syrphidæ</i>, insects also predatory; but this seems to
be rare. In America, similar larvæ are said to feed upon the
"black scale" (<i>Lecanium oleæ</i>). In this country, as far as is
yet known, Lecanidæ are not directly attacked by the ladybirds.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> Quart. Journ. Royal Micros. Soc., Feb., 1885.</p></div>

<p>But this direct warfare by other animals is of small consequence.
A more important check on the increase of many
Coccids is afforded by the indirect action of minute hymenopterous
insects, which make use of them as receptacles for their
eggs. This plan is adopted by several Hymenoptera, of the
families Chalcididæ, Ichneumonidæ, Proctotrupidæ, &amp;c. They
do not devour their prey; they allow it to live that they may
live on it. By means of their long ovipositor they pierce its
body, and deposit in it an egg. As the victim grows the egg
matures, changes into a larva, and still remains in the body of the
Coccid; changes again into a pupa, and by this time the Coccid
is at liberty to die, for the parasite has no further use for it except
as a shelter; then, when the proper time arrives, the perfect
fly emerges and departs. All Coccids are by no means equally
subject to this system. In the United States, according to Mr.
L. O. Howard,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> parasites are found in nearly all genera&mdash;Diaspidinæ,
Lecanidinæ, or Coccidinæ. In this country, as far
as observation shows at present, the Lecanidinæ are the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
liable to attack, some of the Diaspidinæ next, and the Coccidinæ
least of all. <i>Mytilaspis pomorum</i>, so hurtful to apple-trees, does
not seem to be attacked. <i>Icerya purchasi</i>, the worst species of
all, has not yet furnished a single parasitic fly. A few specimens
of <i>Dactylopius glaucus</i> contain parasites; a good many of
<i>Fiorinia asteliæ</i> and <i>F. stricta</i>; while <i>Ctenochiton perforatus</i> and
<i>C. viridis</i> appear to be the favourite victims, as sometimes
scarcely any specimens on a plant can be examined which do not
contain either a larva or a pupa of a parasite. It is to be
observed that in no case is more than one parasite to be found
in a Coccid.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> Report of the Entomologist, U.S. Dep. of Agric., 1880, pp. 350-371.</p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, although this provision of Nature must have a
very considerable effect in preventing the increase of Coccididæ,
it is subject to two drawbacks. In the first place, as just
observed, some of the most injurious pests appear to be unaffected
by it. Probably, up to the present time the worst
plant-enemies<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> in New Zealand have been <i>Mytilaspis pomorum</i>,
<i>Aspidiotus coccineus</i>, <i>Aspidiotus camelliæ</i>, <i>Lecanium hesperidum</i>,
<i>Lecanium oleæ</i>, <i>Lecanium hemisphæricum</i>, <i>Pulvinaria camellicola</i>,
and <i>Icerya purchasi</i>. Here reference is made not so much
to insects which render plants unsightly as to those which
seriously injure its growth: many others, such as <i>Fiorinia
asteliæ</i> or <i>Ctenochiton viridis</i> are ugly enough, but have not
been destructive. Of the injurious species above named none,
apparently, are troubled in this country by parasitic insects up
to the present time, at least to any appreciable extent.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_J_10" id="Footnote_J_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_J_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> Speaking of Coccids only; <i>Kermaphis pini</i> is equally, if not more, destructive.</p></div>

<p>A sketch of Ctenochiton enclosing a parasitic pupa, and of
the perfect fly, will be found in <a href="#Plate_XXIII">Plate xxiii</a> In a work like this
the generic and specific characters of these parasites need not be
given: they do not seem to differ much from hymenopterous
and dipterous insects of other countries.</p>

<p>Another mode by which the too rapid increase of Coccids
is checked is by the attacks of vegetable parasites&mdash;fungoid
growths which permeate the whole body of the insect, and soon
kill it. As far as experience in New Zealand extends as yet
the genera <i>Ctenochiton</i>, <i>Lecanium</i>, and probably <i>Eriochiton</i> are
the only ones so attacked. On certain plants in the forests,
notably Hedycarya and Coprosma, circular spots may be commonly
found on the under side of the leaves: some dark-brown,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
somewhat convex, some bright yellow and often quite
globular. In spring, examination of a young larva of <i>Ctenochiton
viridis</i>&mdash;a species very common on the above plants&mdash;will
frequently show, either within the insect, or on its waxy test, or
between the test and the insect, minute specks, which under
a high power of the microscope, prove to resemble the filaments
composing the brown or the yellow spots just mentioned. On
turning over one of the brown fungi, or on pulling it to pieces,
the dead body of a young <i>Ctenochiton</i> or <i>Lecanium</i> larva will
always be found in the middle. Apparently this brown fungus
does not attack any but young larvæ; but the bright yellow
fungus will be found filling the bodies also of the females in
the second stage, and the globular portion of the fungus will
stand out above them. These fungi are not of the same
genus as <i>Empusa</i>, the fungus which so frequently kills the
house-fly; but they seem to act in much the same way within
the insect.</p>

<p>Probably a good many of the <i>Lecanodiaspidæ</i> are preyed on
and destroyed by these fungoid parasites, of which figures are
given in <a href="#Plate_XXIII">Plate xxiii</a></p>

<p class="caption2">REMEDIES AGAINST COCCIDIDÆ.</p>


<p>Many people are under the impression that scale-insects out-of-doors
are not of much consequence. They are aware that in
greenhouses and hothouses these insects are a trouble to
gardeners, and that they probably injure flowering or fruit-bearing
plants in such situations. But they imagine that in the
open air, and on large well-grown trees, Coccids do no very great
harm; or, if the trees are for a time injured, that recovery and
health will come before long, and the pest will disappear. This
is not the place in which to controvert this or any other opinion.
A work professedly dealing with facts should be as free as
possible from controversial discussion. Whatever, therefore, may
be the grounds of the opinion just stated, or the reasons for
rejecting it, it will be sufficient here to say that there seems to
be nothing to lead to the belief that New Zealand is likely to be
different from other countries in this respect. To institute
a comparison, it would be manifestly absurd to include such
countries as England, or Germany, or, on the other hand, India,
or Central America, or North Australia&mdash;Firstly, because in the
greater part, or at least in the northern parts, of Europe the
winters are much more severe than in New Zealand, and almost
certainly the great cold is injurious to such insects as Coccids.
Secondly, because in tropical countries it seems that the too
great heat is equally obnoxious to them; and, with the exception
of a few species, tropical Coccids are comparatively harmless.
But it is to the warmer temperate or the subtropical
regions that we must look for comparison&mdash;regions where
there is neither too scorching a summer nor too ice-bound a
winter. And, for this purpose, we have only to take such lands
as California, Florida, the South of France or Northern Italy,
the Cape of Good Hope, the southern regions of Australia, &amp;c.
The experience of these is, that some species of Coccids do injure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
in every way, whether as regards ornamental or commercial
value, a number of trees and plants on which the people of the
country depend largely for subsistence or profit. In the South
of France the olive industry has been in some years greatly cut
down. In Florida, California, Australia, the Cape of Good
Hope, oranges and apples have been so damaged that the value
of an orchard or a grove has been reduced sometimes by 80 per
cent. It may be said, moreover, that even in tropical countries
the attacks of scale-insects are often most damaging: in Mauritius
the sugar-cane and in Ceylon the coffee plantations have
suffered from their ravages. The experience of American fruit-growers
is certainly not to be despised, and the fact that both
in California and Florida the people strain every nerve to get rid
of the insect pests on open-air trees would seem to be distinctly
against the notion that these little enemies can be neglected with
impunity.</p>

<p>Nor, indeed, can it be said that in New Zealand itself
the attacks of scale-insects out-of-doors are harmless. Apple
orchards throughout the country bear evidence to the contrary:
lemon-groves can be seen about Auckland where, instead of the
thousands of fruit formerly grown, a few stunted lemons are all
that the withered trees afford; and nobody can glance round
the plantations at Nelson or Napier without recognizing the
devastating powers of a scale-insect (<i>Icerya</i>).</p>

<p>The opinion that Coccids are not likely to do much harm in
the open air is therefore scarcely tenable, and it will be of use
to inquire what remedies can be provided against them.</p>

<p>There is a point, however, to be noted at the outset, and it
is, that in reality there is not, as far as is yet known, any <i>certain</i>
remedy against scale-insects. Not that ingenuity and experiment
have not succeeded in inventing plans and substances
quite efficient in killing the insects when applied to them. It
is easy enough to kill an insect when you can get at it, in most
cases; but the problem in this instance is not only to kill individual
insects, but to do more. What is wanted is to get rid of
whole communities of them, and, at the same time, to prevent
their eggs from hatching and a new brood coming forth. Many
of those who profess to know all about destroying "scale"&mdash;especially
if they belong to that class which prides itself upon
being "practical men"&mdash;being generally quite ignorant of the
habits and life-history of the insects, are satisfied when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
have tried some rule-of-thumb plan which seems to kill most of
the adult insects, not dreaming that they have left the eggs unharmed
and ready to send forth a fresh swarm at hatching-time.
There is another obstacle which often prevents success in eradicating
"scale." This is the difficulty of making sure of the
effects of any remedy. A plan which has answered well in one
place will fail in another, and this, not only as regards different
countries, but even in the same district for neighbouring gardens,
or even for neighbouring trees in the same garden. Tree-growers
must be prepared to find the very same remedy which
has cleared their neighbours' trees fail for their own; and in this
country the author has seen, in one and the same orchard, some
trees quite cleared, while on others, treated in exactly a similar
manner, the "scale" was scarcely injured.</p>

<p>It is from want of knowledge of this and the like points that
persons who have tried various remedies recommended to them
have complained of failure, and condemned both the remedy and
their adviser, whilst really neither was in fault.</p>

<p>Nothing need be said here of carelessness or unskilfulness
in applying a remedy, beyond the following instance: A person
whose apple-trees were being very much damaged by <i>Mytilaspis
pomorum</i> was advised to apply, by way of painting the trunks
and branches, a mixture of kerosene and some other ingredient.
In two or three months he found violent fault with his adviser,
for he said every tree was dead or dying. On inquiry it was
found that, from over-zeal or want of knowledge, he had applied
the mixture as if painting a house, had used it much too strong,
and, to make assurance doubly sure, had given his trees two
good coats of the oil.</p>

<p>An intelligent appreciation of the life-history and habits of
scale-insects is necessary to enable any one to select and apply,
with a probability of success, a remedy, and the details given in
Chapter I. of this work will be found useful for this purpose.
It will be apparent from them that, without regarding the
generic or specific characters of these insects, we may lay down
a few general principles to start with, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>Whatever damage is done is effected by the sucking of the
juices of the plant through the rostrum of the insect.</i> It follows
from this that applications of any fluid to the tree externally,
with the object of poisoning the insects in their feeding, would
be useless, as their food is drawn from beneath the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span></p>

<p>II. Neglecting entomological distinctions, we may divide
the Coccididæ, roughly, into&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind2em">(<i>a.</i>) Insects attacking deciduous plants;</p>
<p class="ind2em">(<i>b.</i>) Insects attacking evergreen plants;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">or, again,</span></p>
<p class="ind2em">(<i>c.</i>) Insects living usually on the bark;</p>
<p class="ind2em">(<i>d.</i>) Insects living usually on the leaves;</p>
<p class="ind2em">(<i>e.</i>) Insects living on both bark and leaves;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">or, lastly,</span></p>
<p class="ind2em">(<i>f.</i>) Insects covered with hard shields or "scales;"</p>
<p class="ind2em">(<i>g.</i>) Insects covered with cotton;</p>
<p class="ind2em">(<i>h.</i>) Insects naked.</p>

<p>It will be clear that a different method will be required for
destroying these different classes; but any one insect will belong
to more than one class. Thus <i>Mytilaspis pomorum</i>, the apple-scale,
belongs to (<i>a</i>), (<i>c</i>), and (<i>f</i>), and indeed may be placed
also in (<i>b</i>), as such plants as hawthorns, which it attacks, are
as bad as evergreens in the difficulty of reaching the insect on
them; or, <i>Lecanium hesperidum</i> is in (<i>a</i>), (<i>d</i>), and (<i>h</i>); Lecanium
oleæ in (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>e</i>), and (<i>h</i>).</p>

<p>As far as regards the injurious species of Coccids it may
usually be taken for granted that those infesting deciduous
plants (class <i>a</i>) live chiefly on the bark (class <i>c</i>), and are either
naked (class <i>h</i>) or covered with a hard scale (class <i>f</i>). If naked
they are chiefly <i>Lecanium</i>; if covered, either <i>Mytilaspis</i>, <i>Aspidiotus</i>
or <i>Diaspis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Icerya</i> is exceptional, being omnivorous, feeding equally on
bark or leaves, deciduous or evergreen plants; it belongs to
every class except (<i>f</i>). Every method of destruction has therefore
to be resorted to against it.</p>

<p>The treatment of a deciduous plant infested by Coccids is
simple as to its method. For two reasons the dead winter-time
must be chosen for it&mdash;first, because, the leaves being off, the
whole plant can be easily got at; secondly, because the eggs of
the insect have not yet been hatched, and the whole brood can
be destroyed at once. The first operation should be the pruning
of the tree, so as to reduce the labour required to a minimum.
A brushing over all the trunk and branches with a good hard
stiff brush and one of the liquid remedies given below is then
often successful. Brushing with a <i>dry</i> brush is adopted by
some persons; but, although this doubtless clears away a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
many insects and scales, and may do the tree itself some good
by cleaning off fungus-growths and incrustations, yet it necessarily
fails to destroy all the eggs, and in consequence the work
is only half done. <i>Any one who wishes to extirpate Coccids must
make certain that he has destroyed the eggs</i>&mdash;a fact which is quite
ignored by numbers of those who glibly talk of their own success,
and blame the advice of others. The object being, therefore,
twofold, the operation should be performed with a hard, stiff
brush dipped in one of the fluids recommended below; and care
should be taken that there is no part of the trunk or branches
escaping untouched. In fact, what should be aimed at is a
kind of painting of the tree, but with a thin coating of the fluid,
so as to close the pores as little as may be; while at the same
time the brush clears away as many as possible of the "scales"
and their enclosed broods of insects and eggs.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind what has been said just now of the want of
<i>certainty</i> in any remedy whatsoever, the tree-grower who follows
these directions will most likely find his work successful and
his deciduous plants cleaned of "scale" on the bark.</p>

<p>A second method may be adopted&mdash;namely, the painting-over
of the trunk and branches, without attempting to forcibly
detach any "scales" with the brush. This, <i>properly performed
and with proper fluids</i>, is likely to be just as efficacious as the
other, for the fluid should "run in" under the scales, surround
the eggs, and prevent them from hatching. It gives less trouble
than the hard brushing, and is equally destructive to the
Coccids. It has, however, of course, not the same cleaning
effect upon fungoid growths or incrustations impeding the free
"respiration" of the plant.</p>

<p>For deciduous trees, then, such as apple- or pear-trees in an
orchard, the simple remedy is severe pruning at the dead of
winter, and the coating of the trees with a destructive fluid, laid
on with a brush <i>on every part</i>, preferably with a hard brush
vigorously used, but leaving a thin coat of the fluid on the bark.</p>

<p><i>It must be thoroughly understood that, a week or two after the
first application, the "scales" left on the tree should be examined,
and, if the eggs are not killed, a second coating of the
fluid should be applied.</i></p>

<p>The treatment of evergreen plants, or of plants which are
attacked both on the bark and leaves, is really the same as the
above as regards its object, but it necessarily differs in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
method. Here, again, it is desired not only to kill the insects
themselves, but also to devitalize the eggs; but in this case the
work is much harder, for the eggs are especially difficult to
reach. Still, there is this advantage: that in dealing with evergreens
the season of the year need not be specially studied, and,
in default of touching the eggs, one may get at the young larvæ.
The remedy is again a fluid, but it must be applied in the form
of spray. Coccids are sometimes found on the upper surfaces of
leaves, but as a rule they affect the lower sides. This, of
course, renders it much more difficult to get at them; and the
ordinary rose of a garden syringe would not, as a general thing,
distribute the fluid in a sufficiently-fine form. The finer the
spray and the more it is forced into every corner and nook of
the plant the better. Various force-pumps and spray-throwers
have been invented for this purpose in the United States; but
probably tree-growers in this country need only procure the
finest possible rose for their syringes, and use them in the
ordinary way. The fluid should be thrown as thoroughly as
possible on all parts of the plant, every care being taken to
direct it most fully against the under sides of the leaves.</p>

<p>The work, then, to be done is in itself simple enough. A
destructive fluid must be selected and applied according to the
character of the insect and its position on the tree. For covered
or naked insects on the bark, apply it with a hard, stiff brush;
for covered or naked insects on the leaves, apply it in the form
of the <i>finest spray</i> thoroughly forced as much as possible into
every nook and cranny, and especially against the under side of
the leaves.</p>

<p>The question, "What is the best fluid to use?" is more
complicated. Many answers have been given to it: many fluids
have been strongly recommended by different people. It must
be well remembered that, as stated above, a sure and sovereign
remedy has yet to be discovered, and failure may attend even
the best suggested at present. Bearing this in mind, tree-growers
will find in the following list the result of the experience
of a number of observers, which may serve as a useful guide.
It does not profess to be more than a summary, compiled from
the researches of entomologists such as Mr. Comstock, Professor
Riley, Mr. Hubbard; from suggestions by gardeners and others,
embodied in various parliamentary and private documents; and
from actual observation and experiment in this country: but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
is believed that the information here given may be accepted and
relied on.</p>

<p>Some of the substances here given are manifestly unsuitable
for general use on account of their expense, at any rate in the
open air. Yet it is well to include them, as they are all suggested
in some work or other, or in the replies of gardeners and
fruit-growers to parliamentary inquiries; and the objections to
them ought also to be known:&mdash;</p>

<p class="hanging">1. <i>Alcohol.</i> Will certainly kill any individual insect; but
"sprayed over scale-insects produced no apparent effect"
(Comstock).</p>

<p class="hanging">2. <i>Ammonia.</i> Whether used pure (diluted) or in urine, damages the
plants much more than it does the insects (Hubbard; Comstock).</p>

<p class="hanging">3. <i>Ashes.</i> Powdered, or mixed with lime, salt, soot, &amp;c. Of no
value whatever (Hubbard; Personal experiment).</p>

<p class="hanging">4. <i>Carbolic acid.</i> Of no avail, either as spray or brushed on,
unless used in such strength as to seriously damage the tree
(Hubbard; Riley; Comstock).</p>

<p class="hanging">5. <i>Castor-oil.</i> Has been found efficacious in cleaning
hawthorn-trees at the Agricultural College, Lincoln (T. Kirk).
It was mixed with soot for some unexplained reason. The time of
the year when it was applied is not stated; but the author's
experiments seem to show that castor-oil <i>does not effectually
kill the eggs</i>. Still, it is doubtless a valuable remedy if
applied repeatedly, so as to kill larvæ and adults, supposing it
to be sufficiently cheap.</p>

<p class="hanging">6. <i>Cole's Insect-exterminator.</i> Apparently a mixture of about 2
parts of "green soap" with 100 parts of strong alcohol. It is
"effectual as an insecticide, and harmless to growing plants;"
but "the cost is too great, except on a small scale, as in
conservatories" (Comstock).</p>

<p class="hanging">7. <i>Gasoline.</i> Seems to have been used in California on pear-trees:
result, doubtful (New Zealand Parliamentary Papers: Codlin Moth
Committee Report, 1885, page 8).</p>

<p class="hanging">8. <i>Gishurst compound.</i> Very favourably spoken of in many quarters.
In New South Wales it has been found efficacious on orange-trees
against <i>Aspidiotus coccineus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span> (Alderton); in Nelson it is said
to be used beneficially against <i>Icerya purchasi</i>. <i>It does not,
however, kill the eggs with certainty</i> (Personal experiment).
Applied warm, and properly diluted, it may be recommended as a
good remedy; but applications of it should be repeated.</p>

<p class="hanging">9. <i>Kerosene.</i> Seemingly the most valuable of all remedies, when
properly applied. "Almost the only substance which will
certainly kill the eggs without at the same time destroying the
plant" (Hubbard).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the application of this remedy must be carefully performed.
Some trees may endure it without injury, even undiluted or
unmixed; but this is scarcely to be expected, and the oil should
therefore be applied in some mixed form. Also, it is important
to remember <i>that a hot sun increases the injurious effect of
kerosene</i>; consequently winter, or cloudy weather, should be
chosen for its employment.</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) <i>Pure kerosene.</i> As just stated, it is probably not
advisable to use this. Still, "a young shoot of orange, not
more than fourteen days old, was uninjured by an application of
pure kerosene which thoroughly wet every leaf;" (Comstock); and
<i>Lecanium hesperidum</i> on ivy, similarly treated, was destroyed,
without injury to the plant (ibid.).</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <i>Kerosene and milk.</i> An excellent mixture, if milk can be
obtained cheap (Riley; Hubbard; Comstock). It must be applied
in the form of an "emulsion," sprayed over the tree or brushed
on the bark. Hubbard gives the following directions for use:
Heat the milk nearly to boiling-point and mix with double the
quantity of kerosene; churn violently from ten minutes to half
an hour, according to temperature, until a creamy thick fluid
is obtained; dilute this with nine or ten times the quantity
of water. The mixture is of course purely a <i>mechanical</i> one,
as far at least as the water is concerned, and it must be kept
constantly stirred, to prevent the substances from separating
from the water. For evergreen trees impel the mixture on leaves
and branches <i>in the finest possible spray</i>. Sour milk is as
useful as fresh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span></p>

<p>The object of the milk is not only to lessen the injurious
qualities of the kerosene, but also to induce it to mix more
freely with the water; but it is the oil alone which destroys
the insects <i>and their eggs</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) <i>Kerosene and soap.</i> When milk is not obtainable, or too
dear, nothing is so excellent as this mixture. Soap itself (see
below) is a useful insecticide, and in combination with kerosene
includes the good qualities of both substances. The cheapest
possible qualities of soap will do. The mixture, which is, even
more than the last, purely <i>mechanical</i>, must be made first
of all an "emulsion." The American experiments result in the
following recipe and method of using:&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<table summary="formula">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl" colspan="2">Formula:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl2">Common soap</td>
  <td class="tdl">&frac12;lb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl2">Kerosene</td>
  <td class="tdl">2 galls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl2"><i>Soft</i> water</td>
  <td class="tdl">1 gall.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<blockquote>
<p>Dissolve the soap in the water heated to boiling, then add the
kerosene, and churn the mixture until a creamy fluid results
which thickens on cooling. Dilute with nine or ten times the
quantity of water: the quantities given above will make about
thirty gallons of liquid. Whale-oil soap, soft-soap, or any
other kind will do. As with the milk emulsion, apply in the form
of the finest spray for evergreens (Riley; Hubbard; Personal
experiment).</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) <i>Kerosene and oil.</i> Castor-oil, linseed-oil, whale-oil,
may be used. A mixture of this kind, in the proportion of 1 part
kerosene to 3 or 4 of oil, has been found very efficacious for
apple- and other fruit-trees attacked by the common apple-scale
(<i>Myt. pomorum</i>). But, as observed above, the mixture must
not be laid on too thick. Thinly brushed all over trunk and
branches, at dead of winter, it has been found quite successful
in destroying both insects <i>and eggs</i>, without injury to the
trees (Personal experiment). It would probably not answer for
evergreens, on account of expense.</p>

<p>On the whole, it may be said that, as far as certainty can
be attained in the matter, there is no substance
better for
destroying Coccids <i>and their eggs</i> than kerosene in the form
of milk or soap emulsion, diluted with water for evergreens or
for trees with insects on the leaves as well as on the bark.
Probably, for deciduous fruit-trees the kerosene-and-oil mixture
is the best.</p>

<p>The great point in favour of this substance is that <i>it destroys
the eggs</i>; this, few if any of the others will accomplish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">10. <i>Lime.</i> Of no avail whatever.</p>

<p class="hanging">11. <i>Lye.</i> Concentrated lye is very frequently recommended. In the
New Zealand Parliamentary Papers (Codlin Moth Committee Report,
1885, page 7) several statements will be found apparently most
favourable to it; yet in places we find admissions that "it
cannot reach all the eggs." In America generally, it has not
been found satisfactory: "inferior to kerosene in killing-power,
and far more injurious to trees when used in solutions strong
enough to be effective as insecticides."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is quite possible that the action of lye on the fungus
accompanying the scale-insects (see Chap. III.) may have led
"practical" gardeners to imagine that it cleaned their trees of
scale. Comstock says, "I saw most excellent results from the
following mixture: 1lb. concentrated lye, one pint gasoline or
benzine, half pint oil, five gallons water." Probably the good
results here were due, not to the lye, but to the gasoline and
oil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="hanging">12. <i>Pyrethrum.</i> Useless against Coccids (Comstock).</p>

<p class="hanging">13. <i>Salt.</i> Useless (Comstock).</p>

<p class="hanging">14. <i>Soap.</i> Undoubtedly a valuable remedy, and perhaps, in some
cases, as efficient as kerosene; <i>but it does not destroy the
eggs</i>. A solution of <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>lb. of soap to a gallon of water,
<i>applied hot</i>, was entirely successful in California: three
months after its application no living scale-insect could be
found (Comstock). The time of the year is not stated. In another
case the solution was applied cold: "four days after no living
insect could be found;" but, again, the time of the year is not
stated, and no mention is made of the eggs. Still, a strong
solution of soap may be said
to be one of the best remedies
against the larvæ and adult insects&mdash;proportions from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>lb. to
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>lb. soap to one gallon of water (Comstock; Hubbard; Personal
experiment).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">15. <i>Soda, caustic.</i> Strongly recommended by many persons. It
injures the tree, <i>and does not kill the eggs</i>&mdash;two things which
are decidedly against its use. Gardeners may have been led to
employ it from finding that in some instances it clears away the
black fungus-growths (Chap. III.), and imagining this to be a
clearance also of the scales.</p>

<p class="hanging">16. <i>Soda, silicate.</i> Kills some insects, <i>but no eggs</i>, and injures
the tree (Hubbard).</p>

<p class="hanging">17. <i>Sulphate of iron.</i> "A common ingredient in patent remedies;"
most injurious to vegetation. It does not affect scale-insects
(Hubbard).</p>

<p class="hanging">18. <i>Sulphur.</i> Another substance, the object of a kind of
superstitious veneration amongst gardeners. It is excellent
against fungoid growth, but of little value against
scale-insects. Here, again, the clearing of the black fungus has
probably been taken to mean also the destruction of the insects
(Hubbard; Comstock; Personal experiment). Comstock says that in
America people often bore holes in their trees and stuff them
with sulphur, under the notion that the substance will be taken
up by the sap, and poison the insects: quite a futile idea.</p>

<p class="hanging">19. <i>Sulphur and lime.</i> A dangerous compound, and useless unless
applied in such strength as to kill the tree. Its fumes are
poisonous, and it may seriously injure the face and hands
(Hubbard).</p>

<p class="hanging">20. <i>Sulphur and snuff.</i> Equal parts mixed and dusted over <i>Lecanium
hesperidum</i> on a wet day were quite successful (Comstock). But
the mixture would be too expensive except for conservatory
plants, and doubtless the snuff alone would be quite as
efficacious.</p>

<p class="hanging">21. <i>Sulphuric acid.</i> "Killed nearly all the scale-insects, and very
nearly killed the tree" (Hubbard). No mention is made of its
action on the eggs.</p>

<p class="hanging">22. <i>Soot.</i> Useless (Hubbard; Comstock; Personal experiment).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">23. <i>Tobacco.</i> A good remedy against larvæ and adults; <i>doubtful
against the eggs</i>. Fumigation has no effect on scale-insects,
except sometimes on Dactylopidæ, or "mealy bugs" (Hubbard;
Comstock; Personal experiment). The tobacco should be applied in
a pretty strong solution; but the expense in this country would
be probably too great for general use.</p>

<p class="hanging">24. <i>Whale-oil and whale-oil soap</i> have been already alluded to
under the head "Kerosene." They are both useful ingredients in
mixture with that substance, if procurable cheaply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the foregoing list it will be gathered that, if experiment,
combined with knowledge of the habits and life-history of
scale-insects, can be relied on, there is no substance better
adapted for their destruction than kerosene, mixed with oil, or
milk, or soap solution, and <i>carefully applied</i>. It has been
already observed that the killing of the eggs is absolutely
necessary for thorough clearing-away of the insects; and, to
quote again the words of Mr. Hubbard, kerosene is "almost
the only substance which will with certainty kill the eggs without
at the same time destroying the plant."</p>

<p>But precautions must not be neglected. Persons who recklessly
use any remedy, or who apply it too thickly or in too
strong proportions, must expect their trees to suffer. Nor
must the weather and the time of the year be overlooked.
<i>Winter is the best season for all remedies</i>; and, preferably, cool
and cloudy days. Again, if substances soluble in water, such
as potash or soda lye, soap solutions, &amp;c., be employed, it must
be expected that a day's rain will wash a good deal of them off,
and greatly reduce their efficacy. These are things which many
people forget; they fancy that because somebody has cleared
his trees with, say, castor-oil in winter they can do the same
thing in full heat of summer; or, because a lye solution has
done well in the dry climate of California, that it will be
equally good in the rains of New Zealand. Still more is it a
fallacy to imagine that rule-of-thumb methods, not founded upon
any knowledge of the nature, habits, and life-history of the
insects, are likely to be really efficacious.</p>

<p>Little need be said here of a remedy which has had, to some
extent, the authority of Professor Riley, and which is recommended
by Mr. Howard (Report U.S. Dep. of Agric. 1880-81,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
p. 351): viz., the transportation or acclimatization of parasites
on scale-insects. Doubtless the thing could be done, as experiments
in America have shown. But there are plenty of parasitic
insects in New Zealand already, and, although they seem to have
hitherto confined their work to the native and mostly to the innoxious
Coccids, they may at any time begin to attack the others,
and it is only a question of time when they will act usefully as
efficient checks (see Chap. IV.).</p>

<p>There is one Coccid of which it must be said that, whilst
kerosene mixtures will undoubtedly destroy it, by far the best
remedy of all is to destroy and burn at once the infested trees.
<i>Icerya purchasi</i> is so voracious and universal a feeder, so repulsive
in its aspect, and so destructive in its effects that the most
drastic remedy is the best. Any one, therefore, having a tree,
especially an ornamental or a fruit tree, attacked by <i>Icerya
purchasi</i>, is strongly recommended to make no delay, but to cut
down and burn every stick of the tree as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It was observed at the beginning of this chapter that some
people hold the opinion that the damage done by scale-insects is
not of importance. The foregoing remarks upon remedies are
not directed to those who hold this view, which is contradicted
by the experience not only of other countries but of New Zealand
itself.</p>

of a specimen might be the monomerous tarsus and the

serrated pointed hairs, as in <i>A. nerii</i>. Four groups of spinnerets:
lower pair with four to six orifices; upper, with six to ten. These

in the abdominal lobes of the female and in the antennæ of the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span></p>

<p>Adult male very small, brown or yellow in colour. The
antennæ have ten joints: the two first joints are very small,
round, and smooth; the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth equal in
length; the seventh, eighth, and ninth half as long; the tenth
somewhat shorter still, and pointed. All the last eight joints
show numerous hairs. The thorax is short and thick, the
thoracic band occupying more than one-half the width; the
abdomen short, the double spike of some length. The wings are
oval, about as long as the body. The legs are hairy, femora
thick, tibiæ longer, thicker at the end next the tarsus than at
the other end; tarsi broad at the top, tapering gradually down
to the usual single claw. The hairs on the femora are much
fewer than those on the tibiæ and tarsi.</p>

<p>Habitat&mdash;On oranges and lemons in shops, very abundant,
often several hundreds on a single fruit; on orange- and lemon-trees,
Governor's Bay, Canterbury; and Auckland.</p>

<p>This insect is European, and has been introduced here from
Australia. It is exceedingly destructive to orange and lemon
groves in America and Australia. Mr. Comstock (Report of the
Entomologist, U.S. Dep. of Agric., 1881, p. 295) records an instance
where a grove of thirty-three acres, which in 1872 produced
a rental of £1,800, could fetch in 1878 only £120, on
account of the ravages of this insect.</p>

<p>Orange- and lemon-growers in the north of New Zealand
should beware of this pest. It is scarcely likely that it should
be harmless here when it is so destructive elsewhere.</p>

<p>The remedies most likely to be efficacious have been mentioned
in the introductory chapters of this work.</p>

<p>A very minute white Acarid (mite) has been observed frequently
under the puparia of this species, among the eggs. The
eggs, in most cases so observed, were shrivelled and dead. Mr. A.
Michael, in the paper above mentioned ("Notes on Tyroglyphidæ")
refers to an Acarus found in America in 1873, also in puparia of
<i>M. pomorum</i>, by Mr. Riley, and expresses doubts whether or not
it fed upon the insect; yet he says, "A Tyroglyphus not ordinarily
predatory might regard a Coccus as suitable for gastronomic
purposes."</p>

<p>Male puparium elongated, narrow, white, doubtfully carinated.</p>

<p>Adult female elongated, segmented; greenish-white; length,
about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>24</sub>in. Rudimentary antennæ visible. Abdomen ending
with a median depression, and inconspicuous lobes; several
scattered spiny hairs. Eight groups of spinnerets: four, containing
each from twenty to thirty orifices, are placed in opposite
pairs, the fifth, with four to six orifices, being between the
upper pair; above these, three other groups form an arch, the
two outer ones having eight to ten openings, the middle one
three to five. Many single spinnerets.</p>

<p>Adult male of a bright scarlet or deep-orange colour. The
antennæ, covered with longish hairs, have ten joints, the first
two very short and thick; the next five long, equal, and cylindrical;
the eighth and ninth somewhat shorter; the tenth
fusiform, and as long as the seventh. The legs are rather long;
the femur thick, the tibia more slender, broadening towards the
tarsus, which is about one-third as long as the tibia, and narrows
sharply down to the claw. Both tarsus and tibia are hairy. The
digitules are fine hairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Comstock proposes the name "Uhleria" for this genus,
because Professor Targioni, establishing his genus for the species
to which he originally gave the name of <i>Diaspis fioriniæ</i>,
changed at the same time the specific name to "pellucida."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
This, Mr. Comstock says, necessitates now an entirely new
generic name.</p>

<p>Targioni's nomenclature has been followed here, as likely to
lead to less confusion.</p>

<p>Female puparium elongated, flat, roughly pyriform or ovate,
thin; the secretion is yellowish-brown or dirty-white, but is
scarcely noticeable, on account of the second pellicle; length
variable, from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub>in. to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>in.; breadth, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub>in. First
pellicle small, at one end. Second pellicle, very large, almost
filling the puparium, roughly pyriform; abdominal region segmented;
cephalic region large, oval; abdominal segments
tapering, exhibiting at the extremity either minute serrations,
floriated lobes, or tusk-like lobes, or a smooth curve; the first
abdominal segment sometimes produced into roundly-triangular
lobes.</p>

<p>Male puparium flattish, elongated; length, from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>in. to
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>in.; white, thin; roughly pyriform, but narrower than that of
the female; central portion slightly convex, seeming on the
under-side to have two keels; not carinated above.</p>

<p>Adult female yellow or brown; segmented; at first elongated,
the cephalic region comparatively large, but during
gestation shrinking up until the insect assumes the form of
Aspidiotus. Abdomen ending in a minutely-serrated edge, with
several small simple lobes, between which are longish spiny
hairs. Spinnerets in an almost continuous arch, containing
seventy to a hundred orifices; several single spinnerets.</p>

<p>Adult male yellow, slender. Antennæ, ten-jointed, as long
as the body; each joint except the two first long and hairy;
the last joint fusiform. Feet, long and slender; digitules, fine
hairs. Abdominal spike, slender, not very long, springing from
a small tubercular base.</p>

<p>This is a variable insect in size, colour, edge of abdomen,
and spinnerets.   On the bark of <i>Pittosporum eugenioide</i> a variety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span>

features remaining as above. It has not been thought advisable
to erect all these varieties into different species.</p>

<p>The male pupa, in its earlier state, is elongated, segmented,
and may be mistaken for a female of <i>Mytilaspis drimydis</i>; but
differs in its greyish-yellow colour, and also in the form of the

<p>Test of adult female brown, hard, horny-looking, convex,
slightly elongated, open beneath, loosely attached to twigs by
the edges; at the top is the pellicle of the second stage, which is
flat, and gives the test the appearance of an overturned basket,
of which the pellicle is the foot. Length of test about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>15</sub>in.
Remains of the thin white test of the second stage may sometimes
be seen on the pellicle.</p>

<p>Test of the male small, white, glassy, elongated, convex.</p>

<p>The young insect, extremely minute, naked and active, is
flat, oval, brown, or rather reddish, usually found at the tips of
young shoots or on leaves. The antennæ have six joints; on
the last joint are several hairs, amongst which is one excessively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span>
long, slightly knobbed. Foot normal; the joints hairy; upper
digitules fine knobbed hairs, lower pair a little broader.</p>

<p>In the second stage the female is scarcely altered: the
antennæ and feet remain as before; but there is a test, white,
waxy, very thin, covering the dorsal surface, and extending a
little beyond the edge in an irregular fringe. On the edge also
are a number of protruding spinneret tubes, glassy, white,
cylindrical, either curved or straight: a few of these tubes
protrude on the surface of the back.</p>

<p>Adult female dark-brown in colour, filling the test; convex
above, flat beneath. Rostrum comparatively large; mentum
probably monomerous. Antennæ short, thick, atrophied; seven-jointed,
but the joints are much confused; on the last joint some
hairs. Feet absent. Four rows of rather large spinnerets
radiate from the median region of the dorsum to the edge, and
along these, on the lower side of the test, are corresponding
narrow lines of white cottony secretion.</p>

<p>This insect is viviparous, the young being sheltered awhile
by the mother, whose under-side becomes concave during gestation.</p>

<p>Adult male dark-red; length, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>40</sub>in. Antennæ of ten
joints, of which the two first are very short; the third much
longer and expanded at the end; the fourth more than twice
as long as the third; the remainder about equal in length to
the third, but thicker and rounder, being almost moniliform.
All but the first two joints bear hairs. Foot normal; digitules
fine hairs.</p>

<p>Habitat&mdash;On <i>Metrosideros robusta</i> (Rata), Milford Sound;
Bluff Harbour.    On <i>M. tomentosa</i> (Pohutukawa), Auckland.</p>

<p>A peculiar species, easily identifiable by the presence of the

<p>Test of female waxy, with a single fringe of tooth-like, more
or less broad, segments round the edge.</p>

<p>Test of male waxy or glassy, with similar fringe.</p>

<p>The edge of the body, in the second stage of the female,
usually presents a wavy appearance, formed by a series of reentering
curves.   This is perhaps most conspicuous in <i>Ct. perforatus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span></p>

<p>The antennæ of the adult female have six or seven joints.
It is often very difficult to determine the number, as the third
joint exhibits frequently a shallow circular depression or ring
which may easily be mistaken for a division.</p>

<p>During gestation the female, which at first fills the test,
shrivels up at one end into a shapeless mass requiring maceration
in potash to restore the original form for examination.
The test thus becomes almost filled with eggs.</p>

<p>The presence of the fringe, which is noticeable in every
species of this genus at some time or other, distinguishes it from
<i>Ceroplastes</i> and <i>Vinsonia</i>. In <i>Ctenochiton viridis</i> the test is not
to be made out in the adult stage but is clearly visible in the
second stage of the female, and it is present, with the characteristic
fringe, for the male.</p>

of which the segments are truncato-triangular. The test is
divided into tessellations, the median row of which is quadrangular,
with two series of pentagonal divisions between it and the
fringe. Near the abdominal extremity a transverse narrow slit
cuts the test in two, leaving a small segment at the extreme end
apparently separate.   Length of the test about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>14</sub>in.</p>

<p>Adult female filling the test, but shrivelling after gestation;
colour brownish or grey. Antennæ of six joints, the third being
the longest, and, as is commonly the case in the genus, often
appearing like two. On the last joint a few long hairs. Foot
normal; the upper digitules are fine hairs, the lower pair only a
little broader.   Anal ring and lobes normal.</p>

<p>In the second stage the usual wavy edge is conspicuous; the
test is thin, glassy, with normal fringe. Antennæ and feet
normal.   The insect is somewhat thick, with yellowish colour.</p>

<p>This insect resembles, to the naked eye, somewhat nearly

the curious perforations in the test of that species, and in the
shorter and thicker antennæ, with also more long hairs on the
last joint.   The test of the male is also different.</p>

<p>Female test golden, waxy, flat beneath, convex above; outline
circular or slightly elliptical, with a fringe of broadly triangular
segments round the edge. Apex of the test an irregular
elongated mass of wax, the remainder divided into two concentric
series of plates, the inner series pentagonal with sharp angles,
the outer pentagonal with rounded angles and with the outer
side forming the base of the segments of the fringe. The inner
series forms often irregular lumps of wax. Diameter of test
sometimes reaching <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>in. The colour is often hidden by black
fungoid growths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span></p>

<p>Test of male much narrower than that of the female, having
an irregularly rectangular edge with deep curvilinear depressions.
It is glassy, white and shining, flat beneath and
elevated above, and marked with numerous horizontal striæ.
The upper central portion is sometimes flat, sometimes an
irregular mass of the glassy secretion. On the lower side there
is often a plate of secretion, so that the pupa is almost entirely
enclosed.</p>

<p>The adult female fills the test, shrivelling up after gestation:
it is consequently flat beneath, convex above, with general outline
of Lecanidinæ. The spiracular spines are very long and
conspicuous; from their base a double row of minute circular
spinneret orifices runs as far as the spiracle, with two or three
outlying ones at the base of the spine; and a single row of the
same kind of orifices runs across the body to the spiracle on the
other side. Along the edge of the body there is a series of
conical sharp spines; and scattered all over are many tubular
projecting spinnerets. The abdominal cleft is deep, and the two
lobes are conspicuous on the dorsal side; these lobes are not
smooth, but irregular, and each bears at the end three or four
strong spines. The antennæ have six joints; but the third joint
often looks like two on account of the false division or depressed
ring: the last joint has several long hairs. Feet normal; the
upper digitules fine long hairs, the lower pair very broad. The
anal ring bears a number of long hairs, of which eight seem to
be conspicuous. The colour of the insect is a golden brown;
diameter averaging <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub>in.</p>

<p>The second stage of the female is normal of the genus, showing
the wavy outline, somewhat strongly marked in many specimens,
but not conspicuous in others. The spiracular spines are
prominent, and a row of conical spines runs round the edge of
the body, as in the adult. The test is at first very thin and
brittle, and with a fringe of broad, shallow segments; but afterwards
becomes thicker, and in the end, before the change to the
final stage, it approaches almost the form of the waxy test of an
adult <i>Ceroplastes</i>.</p>

<p>The young insect is normal.</p>

<p>The adult male is normal of the genus. The legs are very
long and slender; the four digitules are fine hairs. At the
extremity of the tibia there is a strong spine. Abdominal spike,
or sheath of the penis, slightly curved, with a seta on each side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
of its basal tubercle. Antennæ of ten joints; the first two very
short, the rest longer and equal. On the last joint are several
long hairs, of which three are knobbed.</p>

<p>Habitat&mdash;On <i>Brachyglottis repanda</i>, <i>Panax arboreum</i>, <i>Leptospermum
scoparium</i> (manuka), <i>Elæocarpus dentatus</i> (hinau);

<p>The species is distinguishable by the shape and colour of
the test and the arrangement of the spinnerets, in the adult
female. The tests of the second stage may sometimes be taken
for adult <i>Ceroplastes rusci</i>, Linn.; but can be easily distinguished
on examination of the enclosed insect.</p>

expanded at the extremity; upper digitules strong and thick,
lower pair ending in conspicuously broad plates. On the edge
of the body a row of conical spines. Colour almost black.</p>

<p>In the second stage the female is less wavy in outline than
in other species of the genus, and in its later period is somewhat
thick, with the edges turned inwards. Feet normal; digitules
fine. Antennæ short and thick, with six joints, of which the

<p>Female insects naked in all stages; form variable; apodous
in adult stage, or retaining the feet; viviparous or oviparous,

<p>Dr. Signoret (loc. cit., 1873, p. 396) divides the genus into
six series, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1.) Species flat, usually viviparous; example, <i>L. hesperidum</i>.</p>

<p>(2.) Species more or less convex, elongated; example, <i>L. persicæ</i>.</p>

<p>(3.) Species more or less globular, the skin tessellated; example,
<i>L. aceris</i>.</p>

<p>(4.) Species more or less globular, the skin perforated with oval
markings; example, <i>L. hemisphæricum</i>.</p>

<p>(5.) Species rugose, with dorsal keels; example, <i>L. oleæ</i>.</p>

<p>(6.) Species globular, with cleft beneath for attachment to twigs;
example, <i>L. emerici</i>.</p>

<p>The following are the only species reported as yet in New
Zealand; but the genus is so widely spread and the species are
so numerous that doubtless many others will hereafter occur in
this country.</p>

from about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub>in. to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>in. Antennæ (according to Signoret) with
sometimes six, sometimes seven, joints. Abdominal cleft and
lobes normal. The insect excretes a narrow, white, cylindrical
cottony ovisac, which is conspicuous on the leaf of the plant,
and the brown body of the female can be seen at one end of it.
The eggs in this ovisac are numerous, perhaps some hundreds.</p>

<p>Larva and second stage of female flat, oval, yellowish-brown.</p>

<p>Male pupa covered with a waxy, elongated test as in the

<p>Adult male yellowish-grey, the head rounded, with an
anterior protuberance. Two dorsal and two ventral eyes, and
two ocelli. Antennæ of ten joints, all hairy. Feet exhibiting
only two digitules, the upper pair. Abdominal spike short, with
two longish setæ on each side, each pair of which are covered
with cotton which is produced into a long white conspicuous cauda.</p>

<p>Habitat&mdash;On camellia. In the South, chiefly in greenhouses.
In the Hutt Valley, Wellington, camellias in the open
air are much subject to it.</p>

<p>The female of this species is not unlike <i>Lecanium hesperidum</i>,

which usually presents a segmented appearance, due to the
transverse rows of prominent spinnerets. Body covered thickly
on the dorsal surface with spines, which are subcylindrical, the
ends rounded, springing from tubercular bases. On the ventral
surface many smaller spiny hairs. Abdominal cleft normal, the
lobes large. Mentum probably monomerous: the tip bears
several hairs. Antennæ of six somewhat hairy joints. Feet
with rather large femora; the lower digitules are fine hairs.
Anogenital ring bearing numerous hairs.</p>

<p>Adult female elliptical, convex, hollow beneath, brown in
colour, usually affecting the twigs and branches of the plant in
preference to the leaves. Apparently naked, but on close inspection
found to retain at least portions of the thin felted
covering. Dorsal surface covered with great numbers of spines
similar to those of the second stage; ventral surface with many
small spiny hairs. Antennæ of seven joints. The feet have
large coxæ and femora; the tibia is only about half as long as
the tarsus; the lower digitules are only fine hairs.</p>

<p>Adult male of normal form of <i>Lecanidinæ</i>: colour brown.
On the head are six visual organs: two dorsal eyes, two ventral,
and two ocelli. Antennæ reddish, ten-jointed; the second joint
a good deal thicker than the rest, the second, third, and fourth
joints the longest; the last three moniliform; all the joints
hairy. On the five last joints are several hairs with knobbed
extremities. Feet slender, hairy; digitules fine hairs. Abdominal
spike short and rather broad. On each side of the
base of the spike is a tubercle bearing a pair of longish setæ;
each pair of setæ becomes enclosed in a long white cottony
thread, and the two threads form conspicuous "tails," as is common
with most males of the Coccid family.</p>

is smooth; the remainder segmented. The abdomen ends in
two very small anal tubercles, which are nevertheless somewhat
conspicuous on account of their brown colour. Between them
there protrudes a long thick pencil of white cotton. Antennæ
short, with six joints, the last joint bearing several long hairs.
Feet very small; the femur rather thick; the tibia is shorter
than the tarsus by about one-third; the four digitules are long
fine hairs. The anal tubercles have not terminal setæ; anal
ring inconspicuous. A row of a few conical spines, set far apart,
runs round the edge of the body, but none elsewhere, nor any
circular spinnerets. There is no sign of a sac in any stage.</p>

<p>Female of the second stage oval, flatter than the adult, and
of a rich golden colour; length, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>40</sub>in. The segments of
the body are somewhat more distinct than in the adult. The
anal tubercles are proportionately larger, and bear terminal
setæ. Antennæ longer than in the adult, with six joints. Feet
also longer. All round the edge runs a row of conical spines,
set more closely than in the adult; and from each of these
springs a long curly tube of white cotton, making a kind of
fringe to the body; each tube is a little dilated at the end, and
then tapers to a narrow point. The base of each conical spine is
a somewhat large tubercle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span></p>

<p>Young larva free, active, elongated, slightly convex, tapering
to the anal extremity; colour yellow; length, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>60</sub>in. Antennæ
as in adult, with six joints. Feet somewhat large. Anal
tubercles thick, conspicuous, setiferous, with one short hair. On
the edge of the body a row of conical spines set far apart, and
on the dorsum four other longitudinal rows.</p>

<p>Adult male red in colour, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>30</sub>in. long. Antennæ of
nine joints, all bearing hairs; the last joint nearly globular.
Feet slender; digitules fine hairs. Abdominal spike short, thick,
with sometimes a curved appendage. A rather strong seta on
each side of the base of the spike.</p>

<p>As a rule, the adult female is nearly buried in a circular
depression, or pit, formed in the leaf, and with the wall of the
pit somewhat curled over it. On the other side of the leaf is a
corresponding elevation, of a brown colour. Diameter of pit,
about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>18</sub>in. The abdominal pencil of cotton and the anal
tubercles of the female usually protrude at the edge of the pit,
probably to attract the male. After gestation, the female disappears
within the pit, and the young larvæ are also sheltered in
it for a while.</p>

<p>Sometimes two females inhabit the same pit.</p>

<p>The females which are not in pits are generally of a
dark-red, or brown, colour.</p>

<p>Habitat&mdash;On <i>Santalum Cunninghamii</i> (maire), Te Aute,
Hawke's Bay.</p>

<p>A very distinct species, easily distinguishable by the pits on the
leaves.</p>

tubercles inconspicuous; anal ring with six hairs. Antennæ
with nine joints, of which the third, fourth, and fifth are the
longest; the second, sixth, and ninth a little shorter; the first,
seventh, and eighth the shortest. The fourth, fifth, and sixth
are the narrowest, the two ends of the antennæ being thicker
than the middle. The eighth joint is a little expanded at the
tip; and the ninth is fusiform, with a shallow depression at the
extremity. All the joints have a few long hairs, and on the
eighth is one a good deal stronger than the others. The legs
have the tibiæ twice as long as the tarsus; the claw is slender,
and has no tooth on the inner edge. There are only two
digitules (the lower pair), which are long and fine. The
trochanter bears one short bristle. The whole leg is slender
and long. The eyes are tubercular and smooth, showing after
maceration in potash a small dark terminal spot. The body is
covered with a number of spinnerets of two kinds: those with
simple concentric circles are the largest, and are found all over
the integument; the others are multilocular, and are placed in
groups at the edges of the segments and also in great numbers
at the cephalic and abdominal extremities. Interspersed with
these spinnerets are several hairs, mostly very short, but on the
head are some pretty long. From the anal tubercles spring two
strong setæ with tubercular bases, not very long. The mentum
is dimerous, and bears a few hairs on the tip. In the groups of
spinnerets at the edges of the segments are found a few small
conical spines. The four spiracles are small and simple.</p>

white ovisac, longitudinally corrugated; ovisac often much
longer than the insect, and becoming filled with oval red eggs.
Length of female, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub>in., reaching sometimes nearly <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>in.
Body previous to gestation lying flat on the plant, the edge
slightly turned up; on the dorsum a longitudinal raised ridge,
forming one or more prominences. Insect covered all over with
numerous minute fine hairs, most thickly on the thoracic region;
round the edge these hairs are longer, and are arranged in tufts
somewhat closely set; the tufts are black, and contain from
twenty to thirty hairs in each. Amongst the hairs in the tufts
are several protruding tubular spinnerets, having on the outer
end a kind of multiglobular ring or crown; from these proceed
cylindrical, glassy, straight tubes as long as the tufts of hair.
Long, fine, glassy, delicate filaments, as long as the body of the
insect, radiate from the edge all round; but these, being very
fragile, are often irregular, or absent. During gestation thick,
short, cottony processes form at the edge of the thorax, seemingly
attached to the feet. Antennæ of eleven joints, very
slightly tapering; each joint bearing hairs. Feet normal, somewhat
thick. Rostrum not long; mentum triarticulate. Procreation
commencing soon after the first formation of the ovisac,
the eggs being ejected into the sac as it grows; ovisac at completion
containing sometimes as many as 350 eggs; ovisac
convex above, sometimes irregularly split, more often nearly
conical, divided by several regular longitudinal grooves or ribs.</p>

<p>Female of second stage dark-red, elongated, slightly convex,
active, covered with thin meal, or short curly cotton. Body
hairy with marginal tufts and spinnerets, as in adult. Anal
tubercles inconspicuous, but the abdomen exhibits three small
lobes on each side, from which spring six short setæ. Antennæ
of nine nearly equal joints, hairy. Feet normal, thick. Several
radiating, fine cottony filaments. Length of insect variable,
from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>in. to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub>in. The dorsum exhibits the longitudinal raised
ridge, but less conspicuously than in the adult.</p>

<p>Young larva, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>24</sub>in. long, dark-red, elongated, flattish,
active; covered with yellow cottony down. Antennæ of six
joints, hairy; the last joint is much the largest, clavate,
apparently four-ringed, bearing four long hairs. Feet slender;
digitules short, fine hairs. Eyes prominent, tubercular. Mentum
biarticulate. Anal tubercles represented by three small
processes at each side of the abdominal extremity, each process
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">« 106 »</a></span>
bearing a very long seta. Six longitudinal rows of circular
multilocular spinnerets, four on the dorsum and one on each
edge. Alternating with these are rows of hairs with tubercular
bases.</p>

<p>Adult male large, the length slightly varying; some specimens
reach <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>in.; expanse of wings, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>in.; length of antennæ,
about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>in. Body red, with a shining, diamond-shaped, black
patch on the dorsal surface of the thorax; legs and antennæ
black. Wings dark-brown with (in some lights) a bluish tinge,
marked with oblique, narrow, wavy stripes; main nervure red,
branching once; there are also two longitudinal, whitish,
narrow bands.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> Antennæ very long and slender, with ten joints,
which may easily be taken for nineteen, for, after the first
which is short, round, and simple, all the other nine have two
dilated portions with a constriction in the middle, and on each
dilation is a ring of very long hairs, giving the antenna a feathery
appearance.<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> Eyes very large and prominent, almost pedunculated,

long and very hairy; coxæ short and thick, tibiæ long and
slender, claw thin; upper digitules absent, lower pair only short
bristles. Abdomen slender, segments somewhat distinct; on
each segment some hairs; the last segment ends in two thick,
conspicuous, cylindrical processes, which, in side view, are seen
to incline upwards, and beneath them is the short, conical spike
sheathing the penis. Penis red, longish, tubular, and thick,
with many recurved short hairs, and at the end a ring of short
spines. Each of the two processes on the last segment bears
three or four long setæ, but there do not appear to be any of
the long cottony appendages seen in the males of most Coccids.</p>

clavate. Eyes and feet as in adult, but there is no fringe on the
tibia and tarsus. Rostrum and mentum large, conspicuous.
Skin covered with circular spinnerets and minute hairs; the
spinnerets are most numerous on the abdomen. Anogenital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">« 109 »</a></span>
ring apparently folded. At the extremity of the abdomen two
long hairs springing from quadrate tubercular bases which represent
the anal tubercles.</p>

<p>Adult male red or purplish in colour, wings bluish-purple
with red nervures; length, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub>in.; width across expanded
wings, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>in. Eyes large, prominent, facetted. Antennæ
of ten joints, each joint bearing many hairs. Feet long,
slender, with somewhat large trochanter; on the tibia and
tarsus a fringe of hairs as in the female. Upper digitules
two long fine hairs; lower digitules absent. The nervure of
the wings branches twice at least. Haltere large, inflated, sac-like;
bearing four curling setæ. Abdomen distinctly segmented,
each segment bearing many fine short hairs and several small
circular marks. Abdominal spike short, broad, bivalvular;
penis protruding as a long soft white tube covered with minute
recurved hairs.</p>

<p>Habitat&mdash;For the adult female and larva the trunks of trees
and shrubs in forests, or rocks and bushes in open country,
Otago, Nelson, Canterbury, Wellington. For the second stage
the stems and roots of <i>Muhlenbeckia adspersa (complexa?)</i>;
Sumner Road, Lyttelton; Evans Bay, Wellington: <i>Rhipogonum
scandens</i> (supplejack); Riccarton Bush, Canterbury; Nelson;
Wellington. On <i>Muhlenbeckia</i> the waxy tests are often largest
and most numerous underground. Male insects sometimes found
clustering, attached to females.</p>

<p>This is a very large and peculiar species, its transformations
and changes of secretion being abnormal. It cannot be said to
be greatly harmful; but the odour of the second stage is
unpleasant.</p>

<p>Adult female, female of second stage, and larva unknown.</p>

<p>Adult male very nearly resembling that of <i>C. zealandicum</i>;
body red or purplish, wings blue with red nervures. Length of
body, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub>in. Eyes prominent, facetted. Antennæ of ten
joints, slender, with fine hairs. Feet as in <i>C. zealandicum</i>,
but with fewer hairs. Digitules twenty-four, all springing from
the claw, none from the tarsus. Haltere, abdominal spike,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">« 110 »</a></span>
penis, and abdomen as in <i>C. zealandicum</i>; but the circular
marks on the segments in this species are multilocular.</p>

<p>Male pupa bright-red, enclosed in a cylindrical sac of
white cotton. Pupæ occurring in numerous colonies.</p>

<p>Habitat&mdash;On <i>Phormium tenax</i>, <i>Leptospermum scoparium</i>
(manuka), Northern Wairoa, Auckland.</p>

<p>The female of this species will, when found, probably
nearly resemble that of <i>C. zealandicum</i>: at present the great
number of digitules on the foot of the male sufficiently distinguish
it.</p>

<p>This list is of course only approximate, as insects may at any
time be found on other trees than those given.</p>

<p><i>Icerya Purchasi</i> is omnivorous, and it has not been thought
necessary to repeat it here against every plant in the list; but
it has been set against some.</p>

<p>The adult female of <i>C&oelig;lostoma zælandicum</i> may also be
found wandering over numbers of native trees in forests.</p>

<p class="pmt4">Since this work has been in type, the author has received a letter from the
State Inspector of Fruit Pests for California, in which the writer states that the
insect <i>Icerya Purchasi</i> has there, especially in the southern part of the State,
gained such hold on the orange-groves, in spite of the most strenuous efforts,
that the people find it impossible to keep it down. Orange- and lemon-growers
(and indeed other tree-growers) in New Zealand, especially in the North Island,
should take note of this fact, and beware of ever letting this omnivorous and
most destructive insect obtain any footing on their trees. <i>A speedy burning of
every infected tree is the best remedy in this case.</i></p>
